</p>

<p>
A heterotopia is a real space that is derived from an unreal space.
</p>

<p>
Unreal spaces must be somehow accessible from the real space, and therefore have an interface through which they interact with the real space. At minimum, somebody's got to experience them; if the experience is only "in one's imagination", call that a utopia.
</p>

<p>
A utopia comes equipped with a value system because of how it's derived from the real space it's built out of. We typically connote a utopia as being built specifically to define and explore a system of justice; but you could use <i>any</i> value system to construct a utopia. This larger definition admits most speculative fiction.

Utopias and heterotopias are the two simplest constructions of how real and unreal spaces might relate to each other.
</p>

\begin{equation}
Utopia: Real \to Unreal
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Heterotopia: Unreal \to Real
\end{equation}

<p>
Combine these two, and you get a class of things like mirrors. A mirror reflects light, and a human observer (probably any observer that has "vision") perceives a space "on the other side of the mirror", which they know corresponds closely, following well-understood and intuitive principles, to the real space on "this side". Here, an unreal space is derived from a real space; but the observer also uses the unreal space to derive the real space. (It might help to recall here that a real space is also a subjective phenomenon, and the distinction between real and unreal is can only ever be continget, and based on subjective evidence).
</p>

<p>
A mirror is therefore both a utopia and a heterotopia.
</p>

<p>
Let's tease apart some features of the space-relation the the mirror sets up:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mirrors have (near-)simultaneity. Time doesn't appear to play a factor to their function in human experience.</li>
<li>The protocol of interaction with a mirror is fixed - you can't reach into a mirror, you can't make it violate the laws of reflection except by destroying it. This is because the mirror itself, the interface with the unreal space, is real.</li>

Unreal protocols need not be static, and often aren't.

The nature of the interaction and the feedback loops that form are highly dependent on how the representation is created and edited.

I'm looking for ways that participants perceive and change the mechanisms to which they are subject.

Can a highest-bidder auction change to a Vickrey auction by the actions of the bidders? How does one model the act of changing a mechanism one is participating in? What are the incentives involved?
</p>

<p>
The decision to change a mechanism that you're participating in needs to operate by its own mechanism - a vote to change, for example, like is formally done in legislative councils.
