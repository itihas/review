Maintenance is a nightmare. They get to push back against breaking changes as a pretty unique type of stakeholder.
</p><p>The case study specification:
</p><p>PagerDuty has to interact with a lot of third party vendors whose incident reports they collate for both reporting and analytics purposes, who all use different standards.
PagerDuty wants 
</p><ul><li><p>create a useful, unified tool
</p></li><li><p>create a database for providing their service and for analytics
</p></li><li><p>maintain the database schema to remain compatible with every data source
</p></li></ul><p>Vendors want to:
</p><ul><li><p>improve their platform, including making changes to their database schema and API as needed to improve performance or support features.
</p></li><li><p>Change standards as little as possible, because it forces everyone dependent on their standard to also change.
</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with PagerDuty, because users like and use the tool.
</p></li></ul><p>PagerDuty can: 
</p><ul><li><p>propose changes to a platfomr&#x27;s schema.
</p></li><li><p>propose modifications to a platform&#x27;s planned changes.
</p></li><li><p>change their API hnadling layer to remain compatible with a platform by expending effort. (sometimes this doesn&#x27;t work.)
</p></li><li><p>change their standard to better support a platform.
</p><ul><li><p>Potentially affects compatibility with other platforms.
</p></li><li><p>Requires changes to all handlers to support the new target schema.
</p></li><li><p>constrains future changes.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>stop supporting a platform.
</p></li></ul><p>in the face of a discrepancy.
</p><p>Vendors can:
</p><ul><li><p>change their standard at any time.
</p><ul><li><p>propose changes.
</p></li><li><p>accept or refuse change proposals.
</p></li><li><p>accept proposals to amend drafted changes.
</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>This is a market where every move is a rule-edit to a subgame.
