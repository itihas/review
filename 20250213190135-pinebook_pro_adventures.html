</p><p>I did get bored with it quickly upon first purchase, but woke it up again in 2025 because whaddaya know, a lightweight potato is actually the perfect stripped-down writing environment.
</p><p>Performing maintenance on it has been fun. A nostalgic return to Arch, after years of NixOS on my personal driver (and a year of GDebian (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfectly nice for other people) on my work machine). Technically I <em>could</em> put Nix on it, but I quail before the specter of the sheer extent of procrastination that that would represent. Naturally I&#x27;d need a remote build setup (who would build on this baby potato), and then of course I&#x27;d have no excuse not to customize the builds to be optimized for the RockPro...
It has Manjaro on it out of the box, I&#x27;m keeping it that way. There&#x27;s plenty of idiosyncrasy and one-off fixes to do for this thing as it is. (See below for those - most of the utility of this note.)
