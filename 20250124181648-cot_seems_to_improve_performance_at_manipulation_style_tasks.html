Will come back and link later. Basic impression: CoT works kind of like working memory, and is good for kind-of the same things - creating and arranging conceptual chunks of finite number in many different candidate configurations, then scoring these by their fit against the prompt. You can&#x27;t <em>directly configure</em> more than a certain number of things, but you can certainly <em>indirectly</em> search a large space by choosing and configuring handles that help you navigate it. This is a pretty reasonable way to define what I call manipulation.
