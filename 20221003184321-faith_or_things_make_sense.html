</p><p>There is a way in which the world systematically wears down your understanding of the world over time:
</p><p>As you gain experience with the world&#x27;s <a href="id:55b05db4-8350-4387-80b4-16c7774c6cf2">messiness and complexity</a>, or spend extended periods in pathological corners of it (remember, exceptions are often the norm - see <a href="/20210721200800-cfar_modules#adjust-your-seat">adjust your seat</a>), you downgrade your confidence in your models of reality across the board. This happens even if those models are mostly correct, even if you&#x27;re building them correctly, because they won&#x27;t have enough predictive power for you <em>in your locale</em>. They won&#x27;t be of use to you personally. You won&#x27;t experience them as increasing your affordances.
</p><p>There is an optimal error rate for learning for many reasons.
</p><ul><li><p>If you are wrong too often, you cannot put weight on/any/ of your candidate models of reality. You need to be right often enough to know along what lines to build. Subjectively, you will experience this as boredom or fog.
</p></li><li><p>If the stakes of failure are high while you are learning, then you learn first to be very risk averse - approximate correctness might be good enough to iterate on, but that&#x27;s useless to someone who doesn&#x27;t have the opportunity to iterate. This will feel like fear, then rigidity. Coupled with the thrill that comes with getting a high-stakes thing <em>right</em>, you&#x27;ll see dynamics of scrupolosity, zeal, fanaticism; or with a different balance, complacency, cliqueishness, sophistry.
</p></li><li><p>&quot;Approximately correct&quot; is useless for things you can&#x27;t approximate. You need to be content with unrewarding learning for a long period, or receive guidance, to learn things that resist the learning this way. Feel this in drills, mindless habitual brain-training learning modes; rigidity, tradition, the matsarya of selection effects seen from the inside. Also in hopelessness, frustration, despair, often reflected inot worth stories.
</p></li></ul><p>All of these are ways in which learning can be too hard.
</p><p>If you have been playing at a harder level than is optimal for learning for a long while, you develop crutches and bad habits around it that make general-purpose learning much harder later on.
</p><p>Having unlearned those crutches, however, you may see a hesitance that seems broader-based, insubstantial, and inconquerable, beneath all the cruft. Somthing more storyless.
</p><p>This is the systematic buildup of the belief that you are not good at predicting the world, or at moving through it.
</p><p>It&#x27;s the &quot;is&quot; behind the risk-aversion&#x27;s &quot;ought&quot; - the belief that drives the strategy. Your priors on how well you understand your universe. Your sense of how much things in general make sense.
</p><p>Call this faith.
