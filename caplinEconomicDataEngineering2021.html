</p><blockquote><p>In formal terms, even if the econometrician observes actions, states, and
prizes, both the decision maker’s utility function and the posteriors about the
state of the world are subjective (this was highlighted by Machlup, 1993, in dif-
ferentiating between the contents of a transmitted message and comprehension
of it). The path forward that data engineering suggests is to follow Samuelson’s
lead and to conceptualize an ideal data set that allows beliefs and utilities to
be separately identified. In fact this is precisely what Block and Marschak,
1959, proposed when introducing stochastic choice data into economic analysis.
While modeling randomness in utility, they were intimately aware of psycho-
logical models dating back to Thurstone, 1927, 1931, and Luce, 1956, 1958, in
which stochasticity in choice derives from the imperfect ability to discriminate
between “percepts”. For that reason they were powerfully struck by the identi-
fication problem as between beliefs and utility, or “information and desirability”
as they phrased it (Block and Marschak, 1959 p. 1.6).
