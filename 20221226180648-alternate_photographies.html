Why? Well, it seems like going by his later preoccupations with chance, the properties of paint (behaviour under application and removal), and deconstruction of meaning, it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s doing medium-is-the-message-y type things and trying to talk about why the interpretive layer is boring if given too much latitude, and respecting constraints of &quot;what is actually there&quot; or honestly any systematic constraints at all makes for sharper focus and better work - work that accomplishes something.

It&#x27;s important to note that <em>restricting</em> interpretation isn&#x27;t <em>removing</em> it. Photography, whether by camera or Richterian gimmick, hardly removes all interpretation - plenty of room for that in arrangement of the circmstance, from subject to lighting to  contrivances of optics.  don&#x27;t thn t&#x27;s <em>opossble</em> to separate out interpretation from perception in the first place, and it&#x27;s much harder to do in the setting of fine art. It&#x27;s a convention!
