Norman (1978) proposed that there are three modes of learning: accretion, structuring and tuning. Accretion is the addition of new knowledge to existing memory. Structuring involves the formation of new conceptual structures or schema. Tuning is the adjustment of knowledge to a specific task usually through practice. Accretion is the most common form of learning; structuring occurs much less frequently and requires considerable effort; tuning is the slowest form of learning and accounts for expert performance.
</p><p>Restructuring involves some form of reflection or insight (i.e., metacognition) and may correspond to a plateau in performance. On the other hand, tuning often represents automatic behavior that is not available to reflection (e.g., learning procedures).
</p><p>Rumelhart &amp; Norman (1981) extended their model to include analogical processes: a new schema is created by modeling it on an existing schema and then modifying it based upon further experiences.
</p></blockquote><p>Interesting note about this model: two of these modes aren&#x27;t really fruitful to introspect about. Accretion seems to be like &quot;memory&quot; - you didn&#x27;t know a thing, and now you do. Tuning is more frustrating in its opaqueness - you&#x27;re clearly <em>doing a thing</em> with parts and structure, something analytically juicy, but what are you doing?
</p><p>The relative timescales offered don&#x27;t make sense to me. 
</p><p>&quot;Analogical processes&quot;, despite being a plausible addition, makes me want to hiss - no <a href="/20210721200800-cfar_modules#gears-level-understanding">gears-level understanding</a> to be had here. Is this bad qualitative research or nuanced in a direction I don&#x27;t yet see? Maybe we actually read the article and find out one day.
