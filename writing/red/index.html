  <p class="post-info animated fadeIn"> August 10, 2014
    <p>Sensation began at my ears, and pulsed through
my head like successive underwater explosions; blurred echoes rippled to
the edges of my skull, and stirred me from consuming stupor. I&rsquo;d heard
somewhere that, once upon a time, underwater cannons were how they
recovered a drowned body – the pulse shook it loose.</p>

<p>I became aware of my head in its entirety
through the disturbance that consumed it, beginning at the ears and
ricocheting in unpredictable ways. For a moment, nothing else
existed.</p>

<p>The sound solidified and sharpened until it
hurt to hear. I tried to turn away, and must have made a sound. The
clapping stopped.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem to matter. My head was still
pounding to the rhythm of the claps, between my ears and behind my eyes.
I whimpered again, and didn&rsquo;t care that I was doing it.</p>

<p>Feeling returned to my face, my neck, but no
further. It wasn&rsquo;t pleasant, but it would be much worse in a few hours.
I could feel the telltale effects of painkillers in my system – the
disorientation, the slow, ambiguous return of sensation. I tried not to
tense up, paid attention to each bit of returning feeling to make sure I
wasn&rsquo;t tensing the muscle. It was slow, which meant they must have used
the good stuff. That was to be expected, for all that our stock was
dwindling, given the circumstances.</p>

<p>It was both too silent and not silent enough.
The background noise was faint but constant, but near me was quiet. That
was the first and only warning sign.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes to red.</p>
