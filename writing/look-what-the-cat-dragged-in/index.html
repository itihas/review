  <p class="post-info animated fadeIn"> March 12, 2014
    <p>&ldquo;But I love you,&rdquo; he pleads, eyes streaming and voice shaking; a mess of
quaking limbs and blotched skin, dressed in dirty thirdhand rags and
alley-cat hair, on his knees on the expensive carpet I had had selected
and arranged just last week. I sniff, disgusted. Does he honestly expect
his snivelling to make any difference to me? One would have thought he’d
know better by now at least.</p>

<p>Gingerly, I brush at a trailing, fraying bit of cloth with a foot. I’m not even sure it belongs to any garment
– it seems perfectly possible that he fished it out of the gutter
outside a tailor shop.I
try to lift rather than press at it – I don&rsquo;t want to riskdamaging the
carpet any more than he has already. It’s likely beyond repair, but one hasto
show at least that modicum of
consideration.</p>

<p>I’m quick enough to pull away before he catches my leg, thankfully. I
just finished getting myself in order and presentable five minutes ago,
and heaven only knows what kind of destruction he could wreak on my coat
with those filthy hands. The lunge he makes towards me is pitifully
weak, but it’s enough to topple him over; he could be made of wire and
gelatin, all quivers and stiff joints. He lies, sobbing, with his cheek
pressed to the shag pile. He tries and fails to lever himself up again,
and sobs some more. I sigh a little.</p>

<p>A glance at one of the servicemen standing in the background is enough.
They know what’s needed, and will handle it without my needing to
trouble myself one whit more than I have already. I give the heap on the
ground a last look before turning towards the balcony. It’s the only
place in the house where I can be assured of escaping his <em>stink</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice night. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to disturb myself, when I could
otherwise spend the time enjoying it. The air is balmy, the smell of the
sea is coming in from the slight, warm breeze; the lights twinkle above
and below – flickering pinpricks like dust in the sky, and the more
vulgar multicoloured flashes shining up from the spread of land below.
The lights climb the low hills to the south. They look like bleeding
fingers, metrically lit avenue-strips leaking pools of muted rainbows.
It appeals to the nouveau riche aesthetic, I suppose. I’ve been there,
but never lived there. I wouldn’t want to; for all their vulgar sprawl,
those estates make me claustrophobic.</p>

<p>For myself, I prefer to be <em>in</em> town,
not those suburban excuses for
city life.I’m placed directly at the
nerve-centre of the network of lights, but elevated to remoteness from
it; prized territory rather than profligate. It’s well decorated and
cosy, with nooks to hole away in and oversize cushions for naps. The art
is bold and abstract. The furnishings are Art Deco. The colours are
soothing. I pay for comfort, and I pay for taste.</p>

<p>I watch now, perched on the wide railing, as the even patterns shift and
dim. It’s late, for night-blind folks.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s pushed onto the deck through the French windows; they close
silently behind him. I look him over sidelong, unwilling to displace
myself excessively and slightly afraid he’s still in that obscene state
he arrived in. As expected, however, all is well. He&rsquo;s clean, hair
washed and combed, in a cotton shirt and silk slacks, shod in the
smooth, buttery-soft house moccasins set aside for him. Sweet, generic
gardenia perfume wafts its way to my nose. While the cringing expression
and stance is annoying, it takes low priority. I beckon him closer
lazily. Thankfully he&rsquo;s unable to find anything to trip over in the
expanse of empty, sanded wood between us.</p>

<p>He stands awkwardly over me. The silence stretches. He never can handle
much of it. Practice has given him about a minute&rsquo;s worth of liver, and
then, on cue, he snaps.</p>

<p>“Princess. Princess.” he looks at me, desperate. I can read it in his
eyes, the panic that prey undergo when they realize they&rsquo;re trapped –
nothing worth doing, and yet they struggle, blindly, because their
brains tell them to. He has to say something, but he doesn&rsquo;t even
realize what&rsquo;s coming out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Look at me, princess. Won&rsquo;t you believe me? Why won&rsquo;t you believe me?
Princess, I love you, I love you so much. Isn&rsquo;t that enough for you? You
said it was, you did, you did. Princess, look at me—”</p>

<p>His pupils crowd his irises out of the way. He&rsquo;s talking without pause
for breath, but cuts himself off as I open my mouth. More fool him – I’m
only yawning. He watches me, and I can see the threads unravelling from
his mind as the situation truly sets in and he realizes where he is,
what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>“Come with me, Princess. You said you would. You said you would you said
you would you said you would you—” a gurgle of sorts interrupts his
litany in his sort. He&rsquo;s collapsed, sobbing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually somewhat amusing, in one light. What does he expect me to
do?</p>

<p>I sigh. The balcony is no longer silent, and I abandon what slim hopes I
had of salvaging some part of my nice quiet night. I hop down and
saunter past him, close enough to cross his shadow – just to spook him
some more, for the fun of it. He starts violently away, tipping over
<em>again</em>;and lies trembling as
he follows me out with his fixed prey-stare.</p>

<p>The door is opened for me. As I pass through, a soft, delicate hand
travels along my back, nape to tailbone, in one smooth stroke. I stretch
into the touch, pleased; my head curves back to glance archly at the
demure black-and-white figure.</p>

<p>She used to be dressed in cotton and lace once upon a time, when the old
steamboat was alive. Now she’s in silk, from her fair, bare silky hair
to the toes of her soundless, spotless black ballet flats. My orders, of
course.</p>

<p>It was the steamboat, in her ticklish feathers and nubby, itchy velvets,
who left me all this. She won it all from her old mate, of course, but
that was far before my time.</p>

<p>Idiot lady. Somewhere she had told somebody
that the house and the moneywent to either me or her new mate, whichever
stayed in the house with her corpse for thirty days. The fool sitting
outside hadn’t made it a week before running. I think it must have
broken him a little bit, inside his head.</p>

<p>Milk-boned twit. It hadn’t exactly
been easy for me either. Three days in, and the smell was on everything.
It made me *ravenous.*Still
does whenever I think about it.</p>

<p>It took a week after the carcass left
– minus a few nibbles, and who could blame me? – but my peteventually madeit so you’d think you were in an edelweiss
field fourthousand foot square, right in the middle of
the city. I had had about five
minutes to enjoy it – the last of the old upholstery had just gone out
the door when this fool had
tried to let himself in, and
his reek with him.</p>

<p>“We’ll throw him out, my sweet. Don’t you worry.” She massages my back
some more, her long fingers exactly the trick for my sore nerves. We’ve
never needed words between us, my pet and I; she’s mother and lover and
attendant. She knows what I need.</p>

<p>She clucks now, the sound musical in
her throat. “The hag had terrible taste in some things, didn’t she, sweet? What she saw in this fool to *marry*I’ll never know. And to think he still had a key!I took it, of course, but we’ll need the
locks changed anyway.”</p>

<p>She looks at me, indulgent. “And to
think he wanted to make off with you. But you’d never look twice at that
mangy upstart alley
lurker, would you, Princess. He
never made you turn a hair.”</p>

<p>I feel her smile in her fingers, more
than I see it. She picks me up, holds me against her soft silk-screened
bosom. Her fingertips tease behind my ears. “Why don’t we make a show of
it, and have him dragged out by his shirt tails?” Her voice is musical, soft. It has
none of the screechy
pitches of the idiot outside,
and none of the overloudboom that the steamboat’s had
possessed.</p>

<p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,
Princess? And I suspect I
would, too.” She laughs, low
and throaty, at her own
joke.</p>

<p>I purr again, long and loud, in counterpoint.</p>
