  <h1 class="animated flipInX"><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/conversation/">Conversation</a></h1>
  <p class="post-info animated fadeIn"> August 10, 2014
    <p>“Conversations always end too soon for
me.”</p>

<p>“Do
they now.”</p>

<p>I
chewed on my lip, trying to frame my answer. “Either it&rsquo;s awesome, it&rsquo;s
working, and the other person says it&rsquo;s over out of the blue, or it just
peters off, and I don&rsquo;t know where it went.” No, that wasn&rsquo;t right.
“It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re silent, more that it stops working like it
was.”</p>

<p>He
seemed perfectly content to stand where he was, looking at me or through
me as we went on. “You make it sound like a machine.”</p>

<p>“Conversations? Yeah. Lots of delicate
little bits that go in very specific places.”</p>

<p>“And
a lot to get wrong.”</p>

<p>I
twisted a corner of my mouth. “Yeah. That&rsquo;s where the problem is. It&rsquo;s
like everybody I talk to works with only half the blueprint I&rsquo;ve
got.”</p>

<p>The
damp seeped into our clothes as the mist curled. Fingers of it licked at
his ears. He rubbed his jaw, and I followed the motions of his white,
smooth hands. “What is it supposed to accomplish? This machine of
yours?”</p>

<p>I
blinked, and pinched a slip of tissue from behind my lip between my
tongue and teeth. “I don&rsquo;t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, that&rsquo;s an easy
answer.”</p>

<p>“If
I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?”</p>

<p>He
shifted to face me better. He&rsquo;d been alternating between this and facing
the street to my left for the past half hour, always leaning against the
waist-high fence I was sitting on. “It doesn&rsquo;t explain why you keep
trying to build it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I&rsquo;m just curious.”</p>

<p>“Oh,
come now.” He was smirking, but he was serious. “That&rsquo;s not an
acceptable answer.”</p>

<p>I
sighed. “No, it isn&rsquo;t.”</p>

<p>He
let me be silent, trying to think it through.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is. Say I find a way to build
the whole thing – someone with the whole blueprint I have Or enough to
bullshit the rest of their way. Then I&rsquo;ll have finished, and I&rsquo;ll see
what it means, right? That&rsquo;s what I want.”</p>

<p>I
looked at him, and he had his own moment to chew that over. Then he
grinned. “I just hate the word. &lsquo;Curiosity&rsquo;. It sounds so flimsy.
Compare it with someone saying, &lsquo;I want to <em>know</em>.&lsquo;”He&rsquo;d lost the grin at the last, and put
it back with practiced timing. “They don&rsquo;t seem like the same
thing.”</p>

<p>I
was nodding along. “The second is more powerful. As though it could
shake your bones.”</p>

<p>“Split them and eat the marrow.” He
laughed, falling back on the fence to face the street again. I smiled,
and looked down.</p>

<p>When
I looked up again, he was watching me, and the pause had stretched too
long.</p>

<p>I
didn&rsquo;t try to break it.</p>

<p>Somehow, he found the moment, and spoke
again. “Maybe this is the solution to your problem.” He stopped, and
looked at me. I couldn&rsquo;t open my mouth – it had been glued shut from
being kept too long committed to staying that way. He smiled as if he
knew the issue. “How about I stick around until you want me to leave. We
don&rsquo;t have to say anything.”</p>

<p>When
I could, I said, “You don&rsquo;t have to do that.” My voice, nervous, was too
soft, and I had to repeat myself.</p>

<p>He
rubbed his jaw again. There were red spots on his hands, behind his
knuckles, between his tendons. It bought him a moment or two to consider
what he said.</p>

<p>“I&rsquo;m
reasonably certain I want to. I&rsquo;m not done with this yet.”</p>

<p>Damp
made his hair heavy, and it was beginning to drip onto his
forehead.</p>

<p>I
hopped off the fence, and stretched forward with my hands still on it.
Then I turned, and jerked my head to my right.</p>

<p>“Come on, let&rsquo;s go inside. We&rsquo;ll get a
cold.”</p>

<p>He
lifted a corner of his mouth. “Why not. You have hot chocolate?”</p>
