And how do you take
One piece of the whole
And show it to me?
It doesn&#x27;t make sense without all the rest.
But I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed how it made me feel
One part of the whole, and you&#x27;ve rendered it real.
</p><p>What are the dreams that make me break?
You&#x27;ve taken them all
And made the bad good
and made the good bad
Until I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m sorry for
And what&#x27;s owed to me.
An ordering of the best to the worst?
There&#x27;s none to be had. It&#x27;s all good and all bad.
In the middle there&#x27;s me.
</p><p>You&#x27;ve turned it askew
I don&#x27;t know what I knew
Or what I think of you
Why my dreams are so few
Why your dreams are so few
Yet they make me anew.
