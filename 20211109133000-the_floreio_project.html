Read like an assassin: Read Ido’s every blog post, every facebook post, every comment, watch each video 10 times. I have even included a compilation of his best posts at the very bottom of this page.
Remember to get off your ass! People spend more time reading about stretching/training when they should actually be moving!

Mobility. This is of paramount importance.
Hips/Legs
Shoulders
Wrists
Ankles
Skill Work: Choose ONE area to focus on for the day:
Floreio movements at your level (e.g., Beginner variant), usually rotating circuit style
Equilibre (Air Baby and Handstand)
Locomotion (“Walking” in challenging ways)
Strength work, resting adequately in between sets (or sometimes, rest in a squat!)
Prehab: Good to do once a week at the end of your workout, basically just do 2-3 runs of the mobility work.
