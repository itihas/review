My sense of object permanence is not so deranged as to trust in the durability of my hard drive, nor is my sense of causality (mortality?) satisfied with the idea of doing &quot;something for myself alone&quot;.
</p><p>I would like very much to grow past these shackles I&#x27;ve placed on myself where I must believe I will die if the work I care about is ever seen.
</p><h1 id="what-do-you-mean-work-i-care-about">What do you mean, work I care about?</h1><p>Fair question. It&#x27;s not as though I don&#x27;t care about my day job: I&#x27;ve learned at this point not to deride the work I do to make money and fill my day because I can&#x27;t actually <em>do</em> it if I&#x27;m sneering at it. So I see through the murk, notice the bones of reality floating in the fleshy uncertain movements of contingencies and justifications, content myself with those, and find some fire in each day to burn through the next portion of whatever seems to be important or interesting; and if it&#x27;s a little easier each day to drink the kool-aid, to attach my worth to things I didn&#x27;t decide to value, well; I got through school, I can get through a job. It&#x27;s not much different.
</p><p>Writing is different.
</p><p>Nobody has to pay me to write. It&#x27;s fun. The mere bare facts of the process, without further context, feel good and clean and somehow powerful. I think it&#x27;s quite hard to <em>decontextualize</em> writing: words carry their usages into every context. So writing well is like designing a good naturalistic experiment - familiar pieces gently arranged into morally sound yet surprising shapes, making things that might have always been there easier to see.
</p><p>It&#x27;s horrifically vulnerable. I lose myself in the work of arrangement, follow the thread of reasoning around the page, impose and refine and transform frames as I get a clearer sense of the impression I&#x27;m trying to chase down - and then, well, fuck. I&#x27;m done. (And what have I just done? Why does this exist out where people might <em>see</em>? Do you have no sense of shame? I ask myself (something in me asks me?) - beneath the beration, it&#x27;s just a seizing up of my shoulder blades, a burning in my gut - and impending is the wave of cold fatigue that will come over me, the phantom of a literal-feeling wet blanket, that makes it so I don&#x27;t get to do the part that comes next. )
</p><p>I want to get good at the part that comes next.
</p><h2 id="you-havent-answered-the-question">You haven&#x27;t answered the question.</h2><p>It doesn&#x27;t really unbake further than that. I want to do this. I don&#x27;t know why.

It&#x27;s more tautological than that. Words are meant to be read. Spoken, sung, written, read. <a href="/20221214121252-form_follows_function">Tool implies function</a>. It was already apparent when I set out using the tool that I wanted, once I was done, that it was for others to see.

I think simply because it shows seriousness. Who are we showing seriousness to? Ourselves. Why does it makes sense to show ourselves things? Because that&#x27;s how you solve problems, by looking closely at the clearest versions of them you can. The schedule is a tool to support the relationship I want to have with my writing work.
