</p><ul><li><p>slow learners spend more time witht he material than fast ones.
</p></li><li><p>aim to build a teaching strategy that caters to several different kinds of learners in every module
</p></li><li><p>aim to keep the volume of challenge being handled by every student about the same, because you&#x27;re optimizing for time in <em>engaged</em> contact with the material.
</p><ul><li><p>this means for fast learners you need to give them level-appropriate chellenges
</p></li><li><p>this also means that you need many checkpoints, to make a unit of work that creates a decent-sized feedback loop for slow learners.
</p><ul><li><p>also promotes chunking - when you can have handles for smaller concepts, you can express their interrelationships explicitly.
</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>this gets easier when you let students self-direct. set up material with clear signposts and feedback, and let them go forth.
</p></li><li><p>assume memory is functionally infinite - everything gets dumped into the episodic tape reels.
</p><ul><li><p>the challenge is <em>indexing</em> memory along all the axes where it might come into play. all retrieval is <em>contextual</em> retrieval.
</p></li><li><p>therefore, when promoting retention, you&#x27;re going for connection building.
