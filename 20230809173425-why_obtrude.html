Where uninvited, where regretted, where reconsidered
Inviting consideration onto oneself
(it now cannot but be the self, needing defence
(The only defence against rudeness is personality))
It&#x27;s rude.
A word we use to confuse the rude, because all it means is something a human hasn&#x27;t touched yet,
But what we&#x27;re saying is that we don&#x27;t want to touch the thing ourselves.
Obtruding is waiting, out convexly in space,
For others&#x27; vexation to subside, so they may consider you properly. As a strategy it seems
Horrendously vulnerable.
Demanding, really,
Well, obtrusive.
I would never want to do it.
