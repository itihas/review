It is often said that you should avoid using euphemism around autistic people, because they won&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re saying, and will find it confusing. While this may be true to a degree, like all things autism, it isn&#x27;t the whole picture.

Some autistic people understand euphemism just fine, and can in fact be incredibly subtle and sarcastic with their language. But this does not necessarily mean that they don&#x27;t have problems with literalism.

Often, autistic people will hold on to very specific parts of your speech; details that are not necessarily &quot;incorrect&quot;, but are also not in and of themselves correct either.

We all tend to exaggerate, or be loose with certain facts. But often, particularly in heated situations, it can be a huge stumbling block for an autistic brain...
</p><p>&quot;Why do you never do this?&quot;
&quot;Well, I do, sometimes.&quot;
&quot;That&#x27;s not my point.&quot;
&quot;But that&#x27;s what you said.&quot;

Allistic people are seemingly able to understand, generally, that when a question is asked, it may be getting at a point not strictly addressed. An autistic person, however, may be quite surprised when their very specific response is not what was expected.

The reverse is also true; when an autistic person asks a question, receiving a response to your interpretation can throw them off completely. You might see the logical progression, but they may well need that step to get there themselves.

This is not to say that either party is wrong; it&#x27;s just two different sets of approaches and expectations around communication.
