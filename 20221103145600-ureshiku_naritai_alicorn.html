Title: Notes from an article
Feeling optimistic ðŸ˜€
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xnPFYBuaGhpq869mY/ureshiku-naritai">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xnPFYBuaGhpq869mY/ureshiku-naritai</a></p><p>&gt; I labeled my new desired set point - a safe spot on the spectrum, call it &quot;5&quot;, which was ambitious yet felt attainable - as &quot;normal&quot;. When asked how I was in this state, I consciously chose to say that I was &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;okay&quot; instead of something more enthusiastic, like &quot;great&quot;, that I might have said before - the energy I felt at &quot;5&quot; was no longer to be considered extra. Similarly, these were not suitable occasions to do displeasing things. I didn&#x27;t have happiness to burn at &quot;5&quot; - I waited until I was even better before I relaxed my emotional avarice. Instead, &quot;5&quot; was a good place from which to undertake more expensive entertainments that offered net improvement. (More difficult than choosing a specific pair of socks to wear is starting a D&amp;D game, or walking around and exploring a new location, or working on a piece of artwork or fiction; the lag time and effort makes them poor &quot;cheer up&quot; activities, but excellent ways to get from &quot;5&quot; to &quot;6&quot; or &quot;7&quot;.)
</p><p>Further note here:
</p><p>I am not rich in spoons. I am par for spoons. I want to have this many spoons available for things <span class="underline" style="text-decoration:underline">by default</span>, which is to say 80% of the time.
I feel awake and reasonably alert and able to work for up to an hour without a break (but then I need a break). I can do a small activity now with no real consequences. I can cope with a certain amount of emotional stress without becoming overly dysregulated.
I have been much higher-energy than this. This isn&#x27;t extras.
