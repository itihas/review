A cushion, napkin, fork or spoon -
The curtain you part to see the moon -
The lamp you light to see the foolish things you&#x27;re writing as you write
The surface  you are sitting on, when you do this in the night.
  The foolishness of things is like the foolishness of written words,
A simple reaarangement of things you&#x27;ve already seen and heard.
In other places, other rooms.
What you mean now when you say &quot;min&quot;
To a new-made thing upon your page, or
    A pretty something on your shelf
    Is the shell you draw, the thing called self
    Around the things you&#x27;ll use again.
Words on a page you didn&#x27;t write are yours when they are read again,
Again, again, until the things you are is them, or is them too.
  To hide from this becoming, what we say is they belong to you.
