The latter describes three dogmas that come up when reasoning about norms, and offers counters for each of them.
</p><p>ruth chang&#x27;s three defenses against the dogmas:
</p><ol><li><p>when something is normatively right or good, that is only relative to &quot;ordinary substantive normative considerations&quot;
</p><ul><li><p>what does this mean???
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>in goodness comparisions, there are gt, lt, eq, and &quot;par&quot;
</p><ul><li><p>????
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>we can &quot;commit&quot; to a good, ie what is good is &quot;under our direct volitional control&quot;
</p></li></ol><p>pettit argues that &quot;at least two&quot; of these are defensible on the grounds of a naturalistic account of normativity (which is apparently different from what chang uses).
</p><p>said naturalistic account:
</p><ul><li><p>social creatures
</p></li><li><p>want 2 b seen 2 b reliable
</p></li><li><p>do thing called &quot;commit&quot; as a signal
</p><ul><li><p>&quot;commit&quot; is a move that one does by holding / pursuing a desire robustly
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>flip robust attraction and and commitment - and characterize robustly desirable things as things &quot;worth committing to&quot;
</p><ul><li><p>work this out??? is this modus tollens?
</p></li><li><p>call common properties of desirable things &quot;values&quot;
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>will hold different sets of values in different commissive contexts
</p></li><li><p>convergently or concordantly valued properties get moral status
</p></li></ul><p>This sounds like &quot;discovering what is generally true about wanting and calling it a value (or a moral value if it&#x27;s general enough)&quot;; I guess the special bit is filtering it through signalling.
</p><p>We can see this an answer to the question of why we see <a href="/20230909074034-g_e_m_anscombe">virtue ethics</a> in the wild.
</p><p>It also parallels the <a href="id:bd722c21-8dea-4e32-9e01-aed783b69b2f">builder-assistant language</a>. Both are stories about why we see some intersubjective truth in the wild, and both are in many ways the same story. In the center of the builder-assistant language is a <a href="id:4ab65afc-a4ed-4a5f-9cda-66b3aaee82b0">coordination game</a> and in the center of the norm writing is a <a href="/20230909171551-stag_hare_game">stag-hare game</a>.
</p><p>Per this account, you could say that political conservatism is aimed at preserving values by enforcing norms.
</p><p><a title="Where Do Preferences Come From?" href="/dietrichWherePreferencesCome2013">Dietrich &amp; List</a> gives us a properties mechanism that in fact fits neatly into this norms-genesis story, even though it seems like they originally wrote the properties story to discuss <em>homo reciprocalis</em> or characterise altruistic concern as a primitive / atomic value.
