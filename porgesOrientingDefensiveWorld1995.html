Polyvagal theory emphasizes the evolution of this system and proposes that mammals (as opposed to reptiles) have an area of the brain stem (including NA) devoted to attention, motion, emotion, and communication, which can sometimes be at odds with signalling from the dorsal motor nucleus, and this could explain clinical disorders like sudden infant death syndrome and asthma. So polyvagal theory is basically the idea that the viscera are regulated (via the vagus nerve) by two different parts of the brain stem that don’t always play well together.
