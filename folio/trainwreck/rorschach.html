<div id="content">
<h1 class="title">Rorschach on Parquet</h1>
<p>
The
dress was two-layered, and baggy around the torso, falling straight from
the shoulders and held in place at the waist by an elastic band. On a
thinner woman, it might have looked airy or draping. 
</p>

<p>
A
much, much thinner woman. An anorexic woman.
</p>

<p>
From
the elastic, it fell nearly to the ground – would have, if not for the
heels that acccompanied it, strappy plastic-gloss patents in a shade
that brought out the florid pinks of the print flowers vividly against
the black backing. That inner layer lasted only until an inch above the
knees, leaving the chiffon layer – slit high at the sides – perfectly
transparent to the skin. The wispy ends wrapped around her ankles in the
breeze, getting caught on the silver clasps of the shoestraps. They were
far too insubstantial to actually hinder movement, but it seemed like
they would cause her to trip at any moment. Her unsteadiness on her feet
didn't help matters.
</p>

<p>
The
whiskey sloshed around in her heavy-bottomed lowball glass as she sipped
from it, raised it high in the air in salute, moved it in circles as she
gesticulated. There wasn't much left in the glass, but small splashes
found their way out nonetheless, coating her hand and making faded
designs on the pale parquet. The rim of the glass was covered in
lipstick smudges, almost all the way around; near the crook of her
finger was a neat, tiny kiss print, in rich pink that made it visible
from a distance. Her voice, uneven in pitch and volume but rarely
pausing except to breathe and drink – echoed faintly along the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
The
spills were wiped away almost the second they landed, and the talking
could be muffled if it came to that – but her shoes were scuffing the
floor wax.
</p>

<p>
This
was the chief worry.
</p>

<p>
There wasn't much time left to do anything
about it. The waxing happened once every three months, and was
laborious, requiring several days of work, coordinated meticulously to
ensure minimal obstruction of the household's everyday functioning;
sections of the floor partitioned and choreographed like a garba or a
Broadway musical. The wax was an import, and the workers who applied it
were from Delhi. Nobody knew anything about the process beyond
this.
</p>

<p>
There were fifteen, perhaps twenty minutes
left.
</p>

<p>
Warm
water was suggested, and the unfortunate speaker roundly abused. Water
was anathema, this much was known. Various cleaning solutions were
considered, but none could say which was safe and which
not.
</p>

<p>
Five
minutes passed. Panic was setting in. Several of the less experienced
looked about to faint. Hushed voices became hisses.
</p>

<p>
And
in the midst of it, a small canister was produced by a familiar
hand.
</p>

<p>
A
moment of utter silence passed before it was snatched away; a rag was
produced, hisses became excited whispers as it was wet and applied and
the marks disappeared like magic. Bottled absolution.
</p>

<p>
This
done, a few looked up at the saviour, who had moved on ahead of the
train, to catch up with its leader. The procession was stopped by a hand
on the wrist, and the crowd caught up as well, spilling around the
spectacle.
</p>

<p>
Quiet, firm words were spoken. A pout was
elicited.
</p>

<p>
The
whiskey would not be given up, but a bargain was struck to take the
shoes and put them away. House slippers were produced, and the bargainer
bent to effect the change.
</p>

<p>
She
watched, and giggled, swaying forward as if the sound came up out of her
stomach. Then she swayed some more as her foot was lifted, swatting away
an offered hand. When she put it back down shoeless, she cocked her hip,
jutting her leg out of the dress's side slit. She giggled some more, and
there was a collective gasp as she upended her glass over her
shoe-remover's head.
</p>

<p>
After a moment, with movements perhaps a
little more abrupt, the other shoe was removed. The new problem now
stood and stepped back, and there was a rush to wipe away the giant
yellow Rorschach blot that had been left behind. A towel was offered and
used; hair was rearranged. Once-neat cotton, mercifully dark, was dabbed
at.
</p>

<p>
Abruptly, everyone dispersed. The problem was
resolved and time was up. The chiffon caught on the door its wearer had
been whisked through, and was tugged free. The towel was snatched away
mid-use.
</p>

<p>
And
he came walking down the corridor, house slippers
soundless.
</p>

<p>
The
scapegoat had already been seen, but no breath could be heard, even in
the silence of the arcade.
</p>

<p>
He
moved at a measured pace.
</p>

<p>
He
never turned his head. When he reached the stiff figure standing frozen
at the fringe of the path, he paused; sniffed twice, examined it
briefly, and shifted his gaze straight ahead once more.
</p>

<p>
Two
doors past her was his office. The sound of his door closing echoed
faintly in the silence of the corridor.
</p>

<p>
The
unfortunate took a shaky breath, and walked in the opposite direction;
and two left turns later, entered a room and closed the
door.
</p>

<p>
It
wasn't as quiet a corridor as the other, but it wasn't a busy one
either. Anyone who heard the muffled screams from inside passed on their
way after a moment. It stopped off soon enough.
