Works really well.
</p><ul><li><p>Structure notes to generate practice tests on the side really easily. 
</p><ul><li><p>Flashcards are good for this. So is leaving space, like wide margins or the backs of papers, to make up questions.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Prompting recall is better than multiple-choice.
</p></li><li><p>Schedule review sessions, and use these for test-answering instead of rereading.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="distributed-practice">Distributed practice</h1><p>Epistemic status: established awesome.
Hour for hour, distributing practice over days or weeks is better.
</p><ul><li><p>Massed practice leads to false gains. Distribution is better for retention.
</p></li><li><p>Massed practice feels better, but distributed practice sticks better.
</p></li><li><p>Cumulative testing, because that forces repetition.
</p></li><li><p>Study planner; schedule brief review sessions. Use them for test-answering.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="interleaved-practice">Interleaved practice</h1><p>Epistemic status: Promising.
</p><ul><li><p>Mix up the problem types.
</p></li><li><p>Pay switching costs to improve switching times
</p></li><li><p>Pay problem type identification costs, because identifying problem types is hard and practicing it makes you better at it
</p></li><li><p>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for everything - not French verbs or comma rules, for instance. But worth trying anyway, since it&#x27;s cheap and sometimes very effective.
</p></li></ul><p>A natural consequence of <a href="/20240819164946-spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>. Pumps against <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/compartmentalization/">compartmentalizing</a>.
</p><h1 id="elaborative-interrogation-and-self-explanation">Elaborative interrogation and self explanation</h1><p>Epistemic status: mixed, awaiting further study; anecdotally strong, preliminary results strong
</p><ul><li><p>Elaborative interrogation: Explain why the new fact is true.
</p></li><li><p>Benefits understanding and retention, even when not entirely right.
</p></li><li><p>This is wacky as fuck, but I can think of reasons why it&#x27;s true. (Ironic?)
</p></li><li><p>Reasons why it&#x27;s true:
</p><ul><li><p>Connecting up the concept to the existing map is like getting it on the grid. It&#x27;s less likely to die/fall off, because it&#x27;s tightly coupled with an already-useful pattern.
</p></li><li><p>Placing the concept in context highlights misunderstandings/important implications fast.
</p></li><li><p>This is the babble step, and iit invites the prune step. <a href="/babble_and_prune_lesswrong">Babble and Prune - LessWrong</a></p></li><li><p>You&#x27;re only ever explaining your own perceptions. Getting practice with that is <a href="/20210721200800-cfar_modules#pedagogical-content-knowledge">building PCK</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Argument form authority: Given that a resource has told you a fact, it&#x27;s worth trusting the fact as well as you trust the resource.
</p><ul><li><p>Of course, this needs to backpropagate - if the fact is untrustgworthy, the resource should be less trustworthy.
</p></li><li><p>Getting into the habit of explaining the truth of things seems like a dangerous choice. It needs to be kept in mind at the very least, that the authority is trustworthy.
</p><ul><li><p>treating truth as non-exclusive-middle - a thing told to you is possibly true, because no contradiction has been found yet - seems like a decent way to go about trusting a thing that might later be overturned.
</p></li><li><p>It might be wise to attempt to do the opposite very once in a while, as an exercise in hypothesis-generating and to keep one&#x27;s credence limber.

See <a title="Proofs and Refutations" href="/ProofsRefutations">ProofsRefutations</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Good calibration doesn&#x27;t arise from featureless beliefs.
</p><ul><li><p>Aversion to this is part of the arms race that gets built on top of <a href="id:0e7e44d2-5b99-4bc5-abf7-9addca9c8acf">Gendlin error</a>. Sticking to something now, and tying it to its foundations, is scary if the thing you&#x27;re tying down can become necessary.
</p><ul><li><p>It is not safe to believe.
</p><ul><li><p>This is a tragedy, should you define tragedy by the pain that cannot be healed.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You do it anyway.

Apparently fairly useless for retention, inference. Well disconfirmed.

</p></li></ul><h1 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h1><p>Epistemic status: one study mentioned. consensus, litrev???
Useful, but requires extensive training in summarization.
</p><ul><li><p>I...note-take? This seems adequately akin to summarizing.
</p><ul><li><p>Maybe look into how-to-summarize at one point.
