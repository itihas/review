Works really well.
</p><ul><li><p>Structure notes to generate practice tests on the side really easily. 
</p><ul><li><p>Flashcards are good for this. So is leaving space, like wide margins or the backs of papers, to make up questions.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Prompting recall is better than multiple-choice.
</p></li><li><p>Schedule review sessions, and use these for test-answering instead of rereading.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="distributed-practice">Distributed practice</h1><p>Epistemic status: established awesome.
Hour for hour, distributing practice over days or weeks is better.
</p><ul><li><p>Massed practice leads to false gains. Distribution is better for retention.
</p></li><li><p>Massed practice feels better, but distributed practice sticks better.
</p></li><li><p>Cumulative testing, because that forces repetition.
</p></li><li><p>Study planner; schedule brief review sessions. Use them for test-answering.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="interleaved-practice">Interleaved practice</h1><p>Epistemic status: Promising.
</p><ul><li><p>Mix up the problem types.
</p></li><li><p>Pay switching costs to improve switching times
</p></li><li><p>Pay problem type identification costs, because identifying problem types is hard and practicing it makes you better at it
</p></li><li><p>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for everything - not French verbs or comma rules, for instance. But worth trying anyway, since it&#x27;s cheap and sometimes very effective.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="elaborative-interrogation-and-self-explanation">Elaborative interrogation and self explanation</h1><p>Epistemic status: mixed, awaiting further study; anecdotally strong, preliminary results strong
</p><ul><li><p>Elaborative interrogation: Explain why the new fact is true.
</p><ul><li><p>Benefits understanding and retention, even when not entirely right.
</p><ul><li><p>This is wacky as fuck, but I can think of reasons why it&#x27;s true. (Ironic?) Those are:
</p><ul><li><p>Actual explanations can be refined and tied down later, but connecting up the concept to the existing map is like getting it on the grid. It&#x27;s less likely to die/fall off, because it&#x27;s tightly coupled with an already-useful pattern.
</p></li><li><p>Placing the concept in context highlights misunderstandings/important implications fast.
</p></li><li><p>Given that a thing is true, explaining why it&#x27;s true is merely explaining one&#x27;s observations. Given that a resource has tol you a thing is true, explaining its truth is actually an intuitively good thing to do.
</p><ul><li><p>Getting into the habit of explaining the truth of things seems like a dangerous choice. It needs to be kept in mind at the very least, that the authority is trustworthy.
</p><ul><li><p>treating truth as non-exlcusive-middle - a thing told to you is possibly true, because no contradiction has been found yet - seems like a decent way to go about trusting a thing that might later be overturned.
</p></li><li><p>It might be wise to attempt to do the opposite very once in a while, as an exercise in hypothesis-generating and to keep one&#x27;s credence limber.
</p></li><li><p><span class="timestamp">[2020-01-30 Thu 14:12]</span> the suggestion of &quot;thinking about why something is true&quot; already highlights how said truth is extant and nontrivially dependent on the reasons you come up with. &quot;Why do I think something is true?&quot; is a question that breaks a statement down to its cruxes, and allows for the overturn of that dependent fact far more fluidly (and in a way that is true to life) than merely accepting it and attempting to have featureless calibraton stay stable without any reductive logic holding it in place.
</p><ul><li><p>The fear expressed above is possibly Gendlin error. Sticking to something now, and tying it to its foundations, is scary if the thing you&#x27;re tying down can become necessary.
</p><ul><li><p>It is not safe to believe.
</p><ul><li><p>This is a tragedy, should you define tragedy by the pain that cannot be healed.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You do it anyway.
</p><ul><li><p>This is semiotics.
</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>g- Self explanation: Explain things to yourself to place the new thing in context of the old. Profit by having a context to approach new or interesting types of problems from.
</p><h1 id="rereading-and-highlighting">Rereading and highlighting</h1><p>Epistemic status: well damn established, across a variety of learner profiles.
Apparently fairly useless for retention, inference. Well disconfirmed.
</p><ul><li><p>I like rereading sometimes, I don&#x27;t highlight. THis is like, kay.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h1><p>Epistemic status: one study mentioned. consensus, litrev???
Useful, but requires extensive training in summarization.
</p><ul><li><p>I...note-take? This seems adequately akin to summarizing.
</p><ul><li><p>Maybe look into how-to-summarize at one point.
</p></li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="keyword-mnemonic-and-imagery-for-text">Keyword mnemonic and imagery for text</h1><p>Epistemic status: Dunno. One study is mentioned.
Short-term gains, not widely applicable.
