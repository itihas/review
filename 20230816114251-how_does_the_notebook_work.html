It&#x27;s evolved in purpose, and therefore in shape, over the years. The detritus of past attempts is always around.
</p><p>I am going to endeavour to keep this page accurate about how it works relative to the Me Of Now.
</p><p>The notebook began as a place to put things that distracted me - I followed the <a href="/20240905120622-capture_refile_archive">capture-refile-archive</a> and used to capture things I thought of in the middle of working on other things. I captured heedlessly, joyfully, and struggled to keep up with the rapidly expending corpus of lovingly fluffed mental dust bunnies that resulted. There is a little space in my current workflow for this dump-style capturing even now, but I&#x27;m more thoughtful about it to keep the work of dust bunny fluffing manageable.
</p><p>Now, I treat it more like a wiki. Notes are created for ideas that I expect to see large connectivity for. That means that I will want to read, refer, and edit them again many times over. I don&#x27;t mind rewriting things but I hate re-remembering them. It&#x27;s nice to be able to pick up where I left off thinking about something, and also to discover (and cannibalize) past selves.
</p><p>I am often overwhelmed by the things I work out and think and write about, and sometime by incidental details that jog overwhelming memories. This notebook is a forest with dark corners, and I try to remain alert while in here for the sake of not worsening things by reacting heedlessly to what I find. It&#x27;s important to remember that the notebook&#x27;s good memory is only its nature. I&#x27;m the only one really here.
</p><p>I have made notes in the past about how this notebook works, and what does and doesn&#x27;t work in it. They ar true for the moment they were written. This note is also an index page for such notes.
