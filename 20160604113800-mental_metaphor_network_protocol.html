Even more interestingly, perhaps, the progression of the mental state could possibly modeled as each prior agent passing system state to each next one.

The end state consists of a forward-motion-impulse, with an image of large-scope status on top of that, with the heuristic or specialized processing output on top of that, an immediate feeling about the agent&#x27;s behaviour on top of that, and the woven legible narrative on top of <em>that</em>.
Dependency arrows go backward-down one level (or backward-up?). More complex relations are built virtually, inside the top layer. The agent doing the pass-along I want to keep as empty as possible, but the fact that complex processing is unavoidably part-magic at this point means I shouldn&#x27;t try too hard. It&#x27;s a metaphor, and stretching it too far would take us useless places.
This means that when I&#x27;m panicked, I can basically only write panicked stories at top level. When I&#x27;m stuck in a pattern, the recognition needs to be a heuristic thing if it has hope of propagating up the ladder to interrupt. This means that breaking a mental habit has to be a habit too. It also means that if I want to regularly do anything at all I need to find and cultivate the gut-feel space that lets me do it comfortably.
I&#x27;ve been working all along from a selective-intervention model, but the mistake lies in only illuminating the bits I&#x27;d like changed to myself. This makes a good framework for the entire structure I&#x27;m trying to change, and it&#x27;s minimal enough not to feel obtrusive or inaccurate (yet, anyway). Hopefully the selective intervention can now do a better job of exhaustively considering the relevant issues to a problem.
</p><p> I have been shopping for a higher framework of understanding, but honestly, as cobbled-together as my present one is, it&#x27;s not entirely terrible. The principles upon which we&#x27;re operating - keep it minimal, do what works, consolidate when and if you can - are fairly good and well-supported; adherence is decent. It feels cobbled-together, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s in its alpha stages. You&#x27;re not so scared of scrapping it all that you&#x27;ll let it grow on a bad foundation. The foundations you&#x27;re finding when you&#x27;re out shopping for foundations aren&#x27;t working for you, but you have a chance in hell of taking the good things from them as you need. And it&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re not thinking of debuthings - what&#x27;s held you back and is keeping you slow is largely the fear, and that&#x27;ll be overcome by every time you act in spite of it, as you&#x27;re doing now.
