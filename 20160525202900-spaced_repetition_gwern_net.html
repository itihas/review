After all, which is your mind going to do - get good at multiplying 2 numbers (generate on-demand), or memorize 500 different multiplication problems (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoize">memoize</a>)? From my experience with multiple subtle variants on a card, the mind gives up after just a few and falls back on a problem-solving approach - which is exactly what one wants to exercise, in this case. Congratulations; you have done the impossible.
From a software engineering point of view, we might want to modify or improve the cards, and 500 snippets of text would be a tad hard to update. So coolest would be a ‘dynamic card’. Add a markup type like &lt;eval src=&quot;&quot;&gt; , and then Mnemosyne feeds the src argument straight into the Python interpreter, which returns a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuple">tuple</a> of the question text and the answer text. The question text is displayed to the user as usual, the user thinks, requests the answer, and grades himself.
