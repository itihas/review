forgive the fucking invented syntax. Inline diagramming is hell.
I'm only tracking dependencies here. Mostly that's the part that interests me in sentence structure. the nature of each dependency is cool, but too much resolution for pacing/cadence concerns, which is your point of curiosity.
Bold is for shit that's been referred to by something other than its neighbours, italics for pointers to such.
Articles are ignored, even though they're of interest, because it interferes with other shit I want to point out.
</p>

<p>
Pronouns are underlined and resolved with the same italics shit.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that it's possible or easy, all references are made to things that have already been mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Work in progress, to be fiddled with when I feel like it.

This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.

<p>
This &lt;- is &lt;- { a cold -&gt; <b>room</b>} &lt;- in &lt;- {University -&gt; Administration}, <i>room</i> &lt;- {Remington -&gt; hung}, <i>room</i> &lt;- {double-windowed &lt;- against &lt;- {the  November -&gt; heat}}, <i>room</i> &lt;- {<b>insulated</b> &lt;- from &lt;- {Administrative -&gt; sounds} <i>insulated</i> &lt;- by &lt;- {the  reception -&gt; area &lt;- outside}}, <i>room</i> &lt;- <span class="underline">which</span> &lt;- <b>at</b> {<i>and</i> -&gt; Uncle Charles, <i>and</i> -&gt; Mr. deLint, <b>and</b> -&gt; I} -&gt; were -&gt; <i>received</i>  lately -&gt; <b>received</b> &lt;- <i>at</i>.
</p>

<p>
Jesus fuck. Look at the contexts he's switching between on a fucking hair pin curve. This man abuses the fuck out of his copulae. Everything is a fucking adjective or relative clause. (Here btw is a good example of a relative clause - "at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint, and I were lately received.") The only reason to use these is because the order of presentation puts the emphases in the right place for your connotation goals.
</p>

<p>
Also notice the steady increase in sentence length and complexity, scaling user attention demands; 
as well the echo of body position, place position from <a href="#ID-1">1</a> in <a href="#ID-2">2</a> , <a href="#ID-3">3</a>; it echoes the zoom-out, providing more and more context as we proceed. The elaborative retreading of covered ground is a thing that the writing of dialogue might also draw from, since dialogue structure does often perform the function of Elaborating. (old remembered lessons from CL coming interestingly to the fore.) But because he hasn't committed to any address yet, is still in this removed-as-fuck first-person passive voice, already the questions and hypotheses of the reader must draw on the introspective and the dissociative - maybe he's just come awake? Why does the "stage setting" include him as a prop? Is this a satire (for this level of detail presented in this idiosnycratic way certainly feels as though it might be mocking)?
</p>

<p>
All half-formed, of course, easily morphed and discarded as the reader progresses. But enough will linger to cast an affect far further ahead than the specific suppositions might survive. This is what mood is made of.

aaaand we're still in copulae.

<p>
Notice the abruptness, the "wait what didn't I know that" scramble coupled with the "oh right yeah he's been weirdly dissociated in his narrative until now anyway". A bnuch of potentialities resolve themselves - indeed this narrating weirdo is a little wonky in the self-image (and perhaps also in the world-image), and thus it's possible that the funhouse mirror nature setting exposition may not be parody, but an artifact of lens skew. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, the pacing makes this sentence like a fullstop. The Reader's attention, that has been steadily scaling in response to demand for the last three sentences, is fully brought to bear, and like a <i>sccreeeeech</i>-stop in a Looney Tunes short, needs to put a little too mch effort into the pace adjustment. What would otherwise have been an unremarkable sentence, in light of all built context forcibly applied, becomes a moment of surprise and reflection, between breaths where you can hear your own heart beat for perhaps a few more paces than is comfortable. This sort of pace-variance trick is easy to overuse, easy to disenchant a reader with, but the yakety-sax parodylike tone of what we've seen so far - no matter how we may be reevaluating it now (and I'm still not sure) -  make it perversely difficult to not take this instance of it seriously.
