      <description>Smoke and the burn and the restless mad turn
Of the wheels in my head that all churn out cliches that I somehow don&amp;rsquo;t mind and I somehow don&amp;rsquo;t pause
And a million and one stupid thoughts without cause
And the cleverness I somehow catch when they&amp;rsquo;re listening
And foolishness inside my safe simple mind
And rhymes that need use of the useless word glistening and all of the pretty young thoughts I can find</description>

      <description>I loved. I loved, and I was not I
And you were not you
And we were not two
An oeuvre is written in an hour of the night
And none of it true.</description>

      <description>The prettiest thing that you ever saw
Wasn&amp;rsquo;t as pretty as I am today
Nor half as attractive in most of the ways
It&amp;rsquo;s important to be.
The prettiest I ever was is today
But I&amp;rsquo;m as pretty or prettier every today
Today is a day that I know and I care
And I notice you stare.</description>

      <description>Those we count as friends, know the dates of our funerals
And can write our eulogies.
Let them speak.</description>

      <description>My secret soul that hides between
What parts of my world count as seen
Is sometimes moved
And sometimes bruised
And one day it may die.
All the words I ever knew
Won&amp;rsquo;t give it away to you
It sometimes screams
And sometimes dreams
And does it all alone.
It holds within an ageless ache
Because, you see, it cannot break.
It sometimes sleeps
And else, it weeps.
I feel it in my bones.</description>

      <description>We die; we are killed, we are weathered, are felled, are decayed,
We remain living, watching the ghosts that our murders have made
We suffer our punishments at unseen, untouchable hands;
We write our poetry in languages no one else understands.
I look at you, and my mind is unbound, unfettered in storm
Undoing ghost, what were the murders that made such a form?
I write myself over once more for your unseeing eye,</description>

      <title>An Evil Prompter</title>

      <description>Who is the person holding the cue cards
and what does he want today?
Sleep ran off with Night, so I drank with First Light
She washed all my lines away
Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re blank, and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re written
in languages I never learned
Sometimes he&amp;rsquo;s filled them with absolute nonsense
And sometimes he&amp;rsquo;s holding them turned
Who is the person holding the cue cards
and what does he want with me?</description>

      <description>Long did I travel, from home I was far
When I saw you make love to the evening star
That home I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten, and can&amp;rsquo;t find anew
For my world has faded to that star and you.
Venus is fickle, but her lovers are true
You&amp;rsquo;ve yet to return from wherever you flew.
I&amp;rsquo;ll shadow herâ€”though she seems dark to me too
I&amp;rsquo;ll wait in her darkness to once more see you.</description>
