</p><p>We can only ever test <em>recall</em> - can you pass a test of memory (whatever that is), or can&#x27;t you? The thing is, <a href="/strengthening-the-student-toolbox#practice-testing">testing is one of the most effective ways to <em>promote</em> recall</a>, meaning  that there&#x27;s a very strong observer effect to this test. You&#x27;ve got to design your experiment, and your theory, in a way that&#x27;s aware of this.
</p><p>That we know testing promotes recall at all suggests, poetically, a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; principle - a hypothesis that <a href="/20250211163831-recall_measures_instrumentality">recall measures instrumentality</a>.
</p><p>We know that <a href="/strengthening-the-student-toolbox#distributed-practice">distributed practice</a> is better than overlearning - that is, spreading practice out over time promotes recall. So time <em>is</em> a factor in promoting recall.
</p><p>Forgetting, definitionally, also happens over time. The hypothesis that you lose information that you don&#x27;t try to retain it seems self evident, and the idea that you can measure and map it similarly follows.
</p><p>Nice classical scientific modeling question: to measure the &quot;forgetting curve&quot; you have to set up a trial, vary the variable of interest (time), and control for everything else.
</p><p>We turn to Hermann Ebbinghaus, the originator of the concept, who ran a small-scale study on himself and came up with an equation that modeled how his recall behaved while memorising random strings of nonsense syllables:
</p><div class="math math-display">\begin{equation}
b = \frac{100k}{(log(t))^c + k}
\end{equation}</div><p>where <span class="math math-inline">b</span> is &quot;savings&quot; or time saved in memorising a string the second time around, <span class="math math-inline">t</span> is time in minutes, and <span class="math math-inline">c, k</span> are constants.
</p><p><a href="/20240819164946-spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> software sets up a different experimental structure: the trail (a flashcard) is set to show up at an interval that represents the model&#x27;s best guess at &quot;greatest savings&quot;.  We can gauge the model to be accurate based on how well it works - does it converge to remembering distant cards indefinitely?
</p><p>Wikipedia gives us a &quot;simplest model&quot; of the decay:
</p><div class="math math-display">\begin{equation}
R = e^{-t/s}
\end{equation}</div><p>where <span class="math math-inline">R</span> is retrievability (subjective score of how easy a card was is the proxy used in SRS software), <span class="math math-inline">t</span> is time, and <span class="math math-inline">S</span> is stability of memory.<a title="Two Components of Long-Term Memory" href="/wozniakTwoComponentsLongterm1995">Woźniak…</a> (need to read that to develop this idea further).
</p><p>A really good, classic example of science under experimental poverty.
