One for accepting that I want things I can&#x27;t control, one for accepting things that are in my control. Maybe the same one, which helps me distinguish without prejudice between the two.
A litany, a rosary, a talisman, a sign. A nonsensical superstition. Something to quiet the heat behind my eyes, and the resentment in my soul. Something to make the unbearable more bearable. Something to remind me of who I am, and what I want, and what I think, no matter what that is and no matter if it may change.
I need signifiers that are tools, that are the handles to rules I follow and the relief and succour I can find in them. I need to acknowledge, and accept, what it would be now painful for me to give up, so that in running from it I don&#x27;t wound others, and so I&#x27;m not so exhausted.
I need to soften up, and for that I need to find the hard shells I&#x27;ve built and what I&#x27;ve built them to protect. Then I need to show myself that those things need no protecting, and will stay standing without my fear. I need to keep them all in easy reach, and draw what aid they offer when I want and need it. I need to be able to set them aside for any time, knowing without fear that they are there for me to take up again when I need.
