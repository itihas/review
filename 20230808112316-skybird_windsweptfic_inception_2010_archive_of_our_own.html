Instead he can only do it after he&#x27;s heard how sorry Arthur is first - and then he can admit he&#x27;s sorry too, or maybe he only feels it then. You can know all the way around yourself, and this can still happen: a situation where someone is standing in front of you, and you love them, and you&#x27;re hurting them, and you can&#x27;t let it go. Apologies are for the way things are right now. They aren&#x27;t promises to fix it, so much as they are acknolwedgments that this situation and these emotions are going to leave you changed. You might not even know quite how, yet; in fact I think you mostly don&#x27;t. Sorries are stories. Sorries are <em>tragedies</em>. They are markers for everyday and momentous tragedies alike. Dukha. Dissatisfaction. Sorry the world is how it is. Sorry I am how I am and you are how you are. Sorry you&#x27;re hurting. Sorry she died, or he left, or you lost a limb, or a child, or a lover, or a dream.
