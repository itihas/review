1 cup (250 ml) all purpose flour (= plain flour)
1/2 cup (125 ml) Elmer&#x27;s Glue/ Wood Glue
1 tsp olive/ cooking oil and gradually add it up to 1 table spoon (if needed)
1 tsp or more (as needed) moisturizer/ hand &amp; body lotion
1 tsp vinegar
1 tsp baking powder (optional) -&gt; It&#x27;s not necessary actually.
1/2 cup (125 ml) water
1/3 cup (80 ml) corn flour/ corn starch
1/3 cup (80 ml) all purpose flour (= plain flour)
First of all, mix item number 1 to 6 in the bowl. (note: after making few batches, I realize that baking powder is not necessary. You can skip this).
Add water and mix with all ingredients in the bowl Note: you can use electric mixer if you have it but only for few seconds/ fast because the longer you mix the clay with mixer, the softer it becomes. 
Then, add corn flour/ cornstarch - mix with spoon or hands - do not use mixer at this stage.
Knead the clay lightly. The clay is stretchy at this stage but will be too soft to use.
Finally, add the flour again (item number 9) and knead the clay for few minutes with hands (update: Don&#x27;t need 15 minutes though).  Stop when the clay smooth and pliable.  Your hands will tell you when the clay is hard enough for modelling :)
