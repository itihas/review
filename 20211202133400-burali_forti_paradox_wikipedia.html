Let {\displaystyle \Omega } be a set that contains all ordinal numbers.
{\displaystyle \Omega } is transitive because for every element {\displaystyle x} of {\displaystyle \Omega } (which is an ordinal number and can be any ordinal number) and every element {\displaystyle y} of {\displaystyle x} (i.e. under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, for every ordinal number {\displaystyle y&lt;x}), we have that {\displaystyle y} is an element of {\displaystyle \Omega } because any ordinal number contains only ordinal numbers, by the definition of this ordinal construction.
{\displaystyle \Omega } is well ordered by the membership relation because all its elements are also well ordered by this relation.
So, by steps 2 and 3, we have that {\displaystyle \Omega } is an ordinal class and also, by step 1, an ordinal number, because all ordinal classes that are sets are also ordinal numbers.
This implies that {\displaystyle \Omega } is an element of {\displaystyle \Omega }.
Under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, {\displaystyle \Omega &lt;\Omega } is the same as {\displaystyle \Omega } being an element of {\displaystyle \Omega }. This latter statement is proven by step 5.
But no ordinal class is less than itself, including {\displaystyle \Omega } because of step 4 ({\displaystyle \Omega } is an ordinal class), i.e. {\displaystyle \Omega \nless \Omega }.
We have deduced two contradictory propositions ({\displaystyle \Omega &lt;\Omega } and {\displaystyle \Omega \nless \Omega }) from the sethood of {\displaystyle \Omega } and, therefore, disproved that {\displaystyle \Omega } is a set.
