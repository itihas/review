</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The original formulation of Functional Reactive Programming can be found in the ICFP 97 paper Functional Reactive Animation by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak. It introduces the following semantic functions:

</p><p>    occ : Eventα → Time × α

Behaviors
</p><p>Traditionally a widget-based user interface is created by a series of imperative actions. First an action is invoked to create an edit widget, then additional actions can be invoked to read its current content, set it to a specific value or to assign an event callback for when the content changes. This is tedious and error-prone.
</p><p>A better way to represent an edit widget&#x27;s content is a time-varying value, called a behavior. The basic idea is that a time-varying value can be represented as a function of time:
