</p><blockquote><p>
The Algorithm: Outline
The following procedure can be used to determine the status of memory (DSR status) at any moment of time for a given history of repetitions. Once the DSR status is known, we can determine the next interval using criteria of choice, e.g. forgetting index, maximization of stability, long-term workload minimization, etc.
</p><p>estimate item difficulty D using the history repetitions for that item
determine startup stability S0 using the history of repetitions
for all repetition history records repeat the steps below
compute theoretical retrievability Rt using current stability estimate Sw and the interval Int
update Recall[] matrix using D, Sw[n-1], Rt with the grade-derived recall
compute recall-based retrievability Rr
compute grade-derived retrievability Rg
estimate weighted Rw from Rt, Rr, and Rg
compute Rw-based stability Sr
compute SInc-based Se (Se=Sw[n-1]*SInc[D,Sw[n-1],Rw])
compute interval derived stability Si
estimate weighted Sw from Sr, Se, and Si
compute the stability increase SInc on the basis of Sw change
update Sinc[] matrix using D, Sw, Rw with the new SInc value
compute new interval using Int:=Sw*SInc[D,Sw,Rw]
go back computing Rt step
