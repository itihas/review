This acts as a photographic negative, with the parts of the image allowing light through printing on the paper. Any number of copies of the image can be made,[2] and the technique has the unique advantage in printmaking that the design can be reversed (printed as a mirror image) just by turning the plate over. However, the image loses some sharpness when it is printed with the plain side of the glass next to the paper.[3]\n"}]}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[{"path":"/20221226180648-alternate_photographies","title":"alternate photographies"},{"path":"/index","title":"Org-Notebook"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
