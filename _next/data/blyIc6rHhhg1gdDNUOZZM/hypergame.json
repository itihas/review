It is ok for a finite game to have an infinite number of possibilities; for example, the game where player one names any number and immediately wins is a finite game.  It is also ok for a game to have an unbounded number of moves, as long as it always ends after finitely many.  For example, the game where player one names any number N, then N moves pass with nothing happening before player one wins.  This game is still a finite game, since player one will eventually win in a finite number of moves no matter which N was chosen.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To play hypergame, player one names any finite game.
