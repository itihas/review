But it all works out so neatly – and so much better than when anyone else treats the same topics – that I’m always nervous if I’m not familiar enough with the culture involved to know whether they’re being shoehorned into a mold that’s more rational-self-interest-maximizing than other anthropologists (or they themselves) would recognize.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"And also, the cultural evolution idea is really optimistic.

It’s a story of nations and legal systems evolving towards ever-more-optimal and ever-more-efficient institutions for the good of all, and it presents strong evidence supporting that story. I can’t disagree with its evidence from within its narrative, but I still wonder how much to worry about this alternate way of looking at things.\n"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"David Friedman is the anthropologist that bothers Scott Alexander the way David Graeber bothers me.
