When asked how I was in this state, I consciously chose to say that I was \"fine\" or \"okay\" instead of something more enthusiastic, like \"great\", that I might have said before - the energy I felt at \"5\" was no longer to be considered extra. Similarly, these were not suitable occasions to do displeasing things. I didn't have happiness to burn at \"5\" - I waited until I was even better before I relaxed my emotional avarice. Instead, \"5\" was a good place from which to undertake more expensive entertainments that offered net improvement. (More difficult than choosing a specific pair of socks to wear is starting a D&D game, or walking around and exploring a new location, or working on a piece of artwork or fiction; the lag time and effort makes them poor \"cheer up\" activities, but excellent ways to get from \"5\" to \"6\" or \"7\".)\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Further note here:\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I am not rich in spoons.
