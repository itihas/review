Our own memories twist\nIn the gyre set spinning by a spasmodic wrist\nA voice churned to froth by the pianist.\n\nJohn Shade hears the death of his sullen, sweet child,\nAnd sets index cards fluttering in an overtone,\nA counterpoint beat, a resonant pitch,\nAn anodyne for that deep spiritual itch\n\nYou may find in the mornings of indifferent nights,\nWhich marks that what's happened is already done,\nBut you haven't done with it - you don't know how.\nThe things we repeat are the path of a spring,\nMy child's hands did better at pulling apart\nThe meat of a thing than I ever do now.\n"}]}]},"filetags":":poem:writing:","backlinks":[{"path":"/20240822201725-my_writing","title":"My Poetry"},{"path":"/all_pages","title":"All Pages"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
