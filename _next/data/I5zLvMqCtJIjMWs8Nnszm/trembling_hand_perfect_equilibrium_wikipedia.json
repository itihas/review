A perturbed game is a copy of a base game, with the restriction that only totally mixed strategies are allowed to be played. A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy where every strategy (both pure and mixed) is played with non-zero probability. This is the \"trembling hands\" of the players; they sometimes play a different strategy, other than the one they intended to play. Then define a strategy set S (in a base game) as being trembling hand perfect if there is a sequence of perturbed games that converge to the base game in which there is a series of Nash equilibria that converge to S.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Note: All completely mixed Nash equilibria are perfect.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Note 2: The mixed strategy extension of any finite normal-form game has at least one perfect equilibrium.[2]\n"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Related: "},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"id:45b9ef45-80ae-464c-abbb-5e91d6d68aa0"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Stability theory and lonely Vickrey"}]}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[{"path":"/all_pages","title":"All Pages"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
