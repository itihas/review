We suggest that a process-like notion of strategy is relevant\nin the context of interactions in systems of self-interested agents. In this\nview, strategies are not plans formulated by rational agents consider-\ning all possible futures and (mutually recursively) taking into account\nstrategies employed by other players. Instead, they are partial; players\nstart with a set of potential strategies and dynamically switch between\nthem. This necessitates some means in the model for players to access\neach others’ strategies, and we suggest a syntax by which players’ ra-\ntionale for such switching may be specified and structurally composed.\nIn such a model one can ask a stability question: given a game arena\nand a strategy specification, whether players eventually settle down to\nstrategies without further switching. We show that this problem can be\nalgorithmically solved using automata theoretic methods.\n"}]}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[{"path":"/all_pages","title":"All Pages"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
