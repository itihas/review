Well, it seems like going by his later preoccupations with chance, the properties of paint (behaviour under application and removal), and deconstruction of meaning, it's because he's doing medium-is-the-message-y type things and trying to talk about why the interpretive layer is boring if given too much latitude, and respecting constraints of \"what is actually there\" or honestly any systematic constraints at all makes for sharper focus and better work - work that accomplishes something. This my interpretation. We can go follow up if it ever becomes important to get his interpretation.\nIt's important to note that "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"restricting"}]},{"type":"text","value":" interpretation isn't "},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"removing"}]},{"type":"text","value":" it.
