One place to look is whether the firm-agent participates strategically in the game and how. Against players outside the coalition for a given game, it seems obviously to. If the conditions of the game are varied, it might not even exist, and so perhaps it can't be said to participate in any selection among those alternatives. But we have several relations from which we can derive tendencies in the movement from one preference to another. We can for eg characterize it with the Pareto update. We can also try to construct a superposition of two narrowly-deviating games, where the selection between the games is a choice that requires a coalitional consensus; and in this way see what the coalition prefers. Doing this reveals an important truth about coalitional preferences: they can only really distinguish coalitions for sections of strategies that require the whole coalition to cooperate.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This means something important for players of games that have a lot of these types of winning strategies, or are bottlenecked on coordination: player preferences about things that do not relate to coalitional winning strategies will always be ignored or superseded by preferences about things that do.

As game designers we can model consequences but can't perfectly execute on them. However, coalitions narrow play space in a much more organic fashion - by setting up actions and conseuqneces that players inflict on each other for their own gain, you get a system where you can potentially fuzz the details of how the retaliation goes the same way you fuzz the fine structure of a game in probabilistic or epistemic games.
