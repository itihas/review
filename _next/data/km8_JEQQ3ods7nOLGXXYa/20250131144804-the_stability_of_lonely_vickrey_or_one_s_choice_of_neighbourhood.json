It consists of all the possible ways players could choose to play sub-games in order to generate a coordinated strategy. There are likely more dominant sub-game strategies than dominant collusion strategies, and never less (because collusion is a special case of subgame).\n"}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[{"path":"/all_pages","title":"All Pages"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
