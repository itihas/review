The choice to let a child count and sort if it wanted to (one that nonplussed my mother, and I infer that it was part of the reason why she transferred me into a more \"traditional\" school for my UKG the following year) seems to embody a poetic sort of approach to the development of a mind. With this reconstructed account, and what I know of the Montessori method, I can posit that the goal was precisely to do let me do what I wanted. The justifications offered by the philosophy are undoubtedly both causal and moral antecedents to my experience, but they can't really speak for the experience itself. Of course, this all being outside the realm of my actual memories, neither can I.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the interesting things about pedagogy is that any purpose it may serve is only applicable after a time lag - one that takes all involved parties well past the point where extrinsic motivation is available for any of them.
