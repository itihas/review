In a low-trust social enviornment, you get markets, where the books have to balance on a short timeframe; and to enable this you often have coin or cash - fiat currencies issued by a central trusted authority of some kind, or bullion currencies (is that what they are called?) whose value is commonly agreed upon to track the price of the metal used.
