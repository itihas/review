(note: after making few batches, I realize that baking powder is not necessary. You can skip this).\nAdd water and mix with all ingredients in the bowl Note: you can use electric mixer if you have it but only for few seconds/ fast because the longer you mix the clay with mixer, the softer it becomes. \nThen, add corn flour/ cornstarch - mix with spoon or hands - do not use mixer at this stage.\nKnead the clay lightly. The clay is stretchy at this stage but will be too soft to use.\nFinally, add the flour again (item number 9) and knead the clay for few minutes with hands (update: Don't need 15 minutes though).  Stop when the clay smooth and pliable.  Your hands will tell you when the clay is hard enough for modelling :)\n"}]}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[{"path":"/all_pages","title":"All Pages"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
