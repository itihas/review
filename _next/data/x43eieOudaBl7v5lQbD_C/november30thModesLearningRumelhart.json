Norman (1978) proposed that there are three modes of learning: accretion, structuring and tuning. Accretion is the addition of new knowledge to existing memory. Structuring involves the formation of new conceptual structures or schema. Tuning is the adjustment of knowledge to a specific task usually through practice. Accretion is the most common form of learning; structuring occurs much less frequently and requires considerable effort; tuning is the slowest form of learning and accounts for expert performance.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Restructuring involves some form of reflection or insight (i.e., metacognition) and may correspond to a plateau in performance.
