We \"hold the phone\" - when something goes wrong, we get called. We also solve for slack  - our need is felt when everything is always on fire, or when nobody can overcome the friction of a system to actually do anything meaningful. We are meant to learn scientifically and solve strategically.

The role exists because that illegible work done at the edge is a goldmine for insight - reality is surprisingly detailed, and its detail betrays otherwise inaccessibler truths about its deep nature. Doing engineering at that edge involves learning scientifically and solving strategically.\n"}]}]},"filetags":{},"backlinks":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
