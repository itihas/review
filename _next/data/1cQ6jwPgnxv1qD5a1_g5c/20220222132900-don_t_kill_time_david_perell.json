When the weight of invisible agony pressed hard enough on his eyelids, he’d pass out. Some days, I’d come home at 6pm to find him can’t-even-wake-him-up sleeping on the couch. Later, we discovered that he was taking emergency-room-grade anxiety medications every morning, and drowning himself to sleep with Heineken, always a Heineken, in the evening. Ironically, he was writing his PhD thesis on tobacco addiction treatment, and sadly, it wasn’t curing his own addiction. He was caught between the rock of loneliness and the hard place of an evaporating bank account. Slowly, his anxiety turned into a gloomy depression — not sadness, but a bland disposition where he didn’t feel anything.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"He was also late on his rent.

It wasn’t a Stoic, powerful calmness. It was a helpless calm, where nothing was worth doing because the world was too difficult. Perhaps he was allergic to people. He was so burdened by life, and so overwhelmed by his thesis, that the only thing he wanted to do was “veg out” and kill time.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At some point, it occurred to me that there’s a Mark in all of us — a person who can’t confront the challenges of the modern world and can’t resist the allure of distractions from it. A person who is cynical about everything because pessimism requires no imagination. A person so paralyzed by the tyranny of judgement that they close the door, retreat to the couch, and watch others live their lives on TV instead of walking the pavement themselves. And whenever that person surfaces, so does the desire to kill time. \n"}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":" Witnessing a breakdown from the outside - and the alienation it causes.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"See "},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"/20220221101500-neuroanthropology_understanding_the_encultured_brain"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Neuroanthropology – Understanding the encultured brain"}]},{"type":"text","value":" .
