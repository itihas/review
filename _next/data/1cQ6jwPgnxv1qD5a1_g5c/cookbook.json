I suppose it finally is time to start writing again in earnest.\nOn the other hand, my passins are not what they were when last I did this sort of thing. I'm simpler, and older, and far too aware of the ways in which I sound like a spoiled child to myself. I don't know how to indulge, and my youthful genius has, alas, passed with those foibles.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"(Or maybe it hasn't, but let's not unearth those fears just yet.

You're stuck with yourselves, and so am I. There is no amount of self care that will do more than keep me living, at this point, so let's put some attention where the bulk of my Sisyphean effort feels well spent these days. If your idle curiosity or your philsophy seminar needs you to reflect on the circularity of time and narratives, take my word for it that there's nothing quite like your mother's most hated chore becoming your only remaining touchpoint to sanity.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"moussaka-or-how-to-dress-up-your-root-vegetables-and-dairy"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Moussaka; or, how to dress up your root vegetables and dairy."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you're like me, and in this solipsistic blog universe who isn't, you stockpiled; and, having stockpiled, feel embarassed, nervous, deeply satisfied and yet almost nauseated, looking at the fruits of your labours.\nIf you're like me, your idea of a stockpile is fairly akin to every vague cliche you've ever heard about the European peasantry, coupled with every small-scale kitchen shortage emergency you ever witnessed in your childhood.\nI don't know if anyone reading is like me. Of course, principle of explosion, I can decide you are, and have a laugh with you. You've got too much dairy, and you've got too many root vegetables.

If so, you're wise; or at least I think myself wise for not questioning that too closely. Look, disasters can't be reasoned about easily. The quiet voice in the undertow has a point that I don't want to look at too closely, just yet. I don't want to think about the ways in which the world changed over the course of the first half of March 2020. I don't want to question my instincts, to second guess their fear. They are doing a job that I don't want to do. They are preparing for a world that I don't understand, by getting me what I know I'll need in any case. Things that will last, that won't go to waste.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If I can't justify these instincts, at least I can forgive them.

That's been the challenge all day, hasn't it? I'm treating being trapped as an adventure, because adulthood teaches you to choose your approach to an problem and I've chosen to handle this one as an exciting new adversary with a story buried in it. But that doesn't let me escape the problems of today, or the fact that everything about today is new. It's not an aberration in my old routine; it's the creation of the routine that will replace the one that got destroyed last week, after over a year of careful work cultivating it into something approximating functional adult humanity.\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It's been so seamless, hasn't it, the process of remembering research student habits, of reconstructing your Day to match what your mind half-remembers and your bones never forgot?

It's going to be worse going forward, I'm sure; you half apologize to them for doing better than they are, and half portend, in an attempt to convey what you yourself only half understand. The fact is, you're better equipped to handle this than so many of the others. Egotistic as it feels to think it, frightening as it is to realize you mean it, it's true.
