<p>
I was speaking mostly tongue-in-cheek.  But in fact there are coherence theorems saying that either you have consistent quantitative tradeoffs between the things you want, or your strategies can be rearranged to get you strictly more of everything you want.  I think that truly understanding these theorems is not compatible with being horrified at the prospect of pricing one thing in terms of another thing.  I think that there is a true bit of mathematical enlightenment that you get, and see into the structure of choicemaking, and then you are less horrified by the thought of pricing things in money.

“Being so ugly,” she continues calmly, as though this makes perfect sense, “I wanted to change myself so thoroughly that others would look to me on stage and say: how far Lilia Baranovskaya has come.” A pause then, carefully timed. “Katsuki. Do you think this made me prima ballerina?” 
The obvious answer is yes, because Lillia had been.
</p>

<p>
“Something else?” Yuuri asks, unsteady.
</p>

<p>
“When I became prima ballerina,” she says, “it was because they would look to me on stage and say: who is that beautiful monster.” She comes to him, tilts his chin up in unshaking, perfect hands. “Destroy your past self, and only use the beautiful pieces. Every time you take the stage you are a new man, Katsuki Yuuri, with something new to prove.” Her eyes, burning on his. “We do not let old lives dance with us.”

<p>
Two lovers meet, and cry for a week, without stopping, into their pillows as they sleep, salting their meals as they eat. Still weeping, they marry. The marriage bed becomes soaked, as if left out in the rain. And once they slept that night, the thears stopped, and when they woke up the next morning they had cried out all the sadness of seventeen years and felt perfectly happy from then until the end of their days. Hopeful lovers will leave their bedroom windows open, that lovers might bless their bed with rain; and a marriage bed might, by the romantic or the very old, be blessed with saltwater.

What is it you need of me?<br />
If I could I'd find a way to give it, so you'd leave, and stop this<br />
Asking after things I'd rather leave beneath the dust you found them in.<br />

Dress me, then, in dust of attics<br />
Shelves above the kitchen shelves<br />

Pleasure in its fullest bloom<br />

recc from that new coworking discord I joined, relating to the FIRO model. quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ran across a model yesterday called FIRO (Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation) that grades people on three metrics: Inclusion, Control, and Openness.
</p>

<p>
On a scale of 0 to 9, how much do you want other people to include you (keep you in the loop with emails, invite you to parties, chat with you just for fun, ask for your input before making a decision, etc)? How much do you like to include other people?
</p>

<p>
On a scale of 0 to 9, how much do you want other people to control your work (guide your activities, help you schedule, select your priorities, decide how you achieve your goals, etc)? How much do you want to control other people? 
</p>

<p>
On a scale of 0 to 9, how much do you want to share with other people about yourself (talk about your feelings, hopes, fears, doubts, share details about your life, etc)? How much do you want others to be open with you?
I only encountered this yesterday, and have done no more research than what's in the summary in this book, so I have no idea how well it holds up beyond the author's reassurance that it does, nor how it may have been misused by managers through the ages.  But what I like about it is that it explains a mystery about myself I've been struggling with for a while: it explains my wildly varying sociability scores. 
</p>

<p>
In most models I've seen, openness and inclusion are lumped together into some overarching "extraversion" or "people-person" sort of metric, and then both I and other people end up very confused about who I am and what I want.  But by splitting them out, it becomes quite clear. 
</p>

<p>
The typical bro-friendship in Hollywood right now, for instance, is high-inclusion and low-openness: you wanna hang out with your buddies all the time, but you never want the conversation to get into anything icky like emotions and stuff.  You'll often see female friendships portrayed as high-inclusion and high-openness: gal-pals will get together, paint their fingernails, and talk about everything from their digestive tract to how good their partner is in bed.
</p>

<p>
In this model, I'm high-openness and low-inclusion: I'm happy to talk about whatever, and I don't mind going as deep and as vulnerable as anyone wants, but I just don't feel the need to be involved very much no matter what the topic of discussion.  I'll hop in if I feel like the group is missing something important, but if everything's flowing nicely then I prefer to sit on the sidelines.  If we're working on a project together, and there's a decision to be made that clearly falls within your purview, then I don't feel the need to tell you how to do it &#x2013; just make the decision and tell me what you decided.  I like hanging out in spaces like this, but I don't want to be one of the most active members, I don't want to run tea time, I don't want to be a moderator or to have special permissions.  I like lurking.
And that probably explains, more than any other factor, why my mental and spiritual health are doing fine after 9 months of lockdown with no end in sight: I just don't like going to parties that much. I don't need to be face-to-face to experience the level of inclusion I want.  I can get all my needs met from Discord and Zoom.  And as another consequence, the productivity gain from hermit mode is well worth it: I get to do the things I want to do AND I get to work by myself.
My suspicion , Sri, is that you are high-inclusion, and therefore hermit-mode productivity is fraught with tension: You want to get things done, because that makes you happy, but blocking yourself off from other people makes you unhappy.  You want to hang out with people because that makes you happy, but it stops you creating things at the level you want to.  And so you end up stuck in this middle place where you can't be fully happy no matter what you decide.

More than "enough", going by feeling. Abundant. Depression and wrongdoing and desire and suffering are all a distraction from that truth. Facing that truth is difficult, because it makes me feel undeserving. Or naive. Or foolish. It is hard to create a life or live a life that lives up to that much joy. And desire is a lot of fun. Maybe I want to hang around here, feeling this feeling, and finding a life that fits it, for awhile longer.

Think of DNA and reimplementation. Question: how often on average are things reimplemented in DNA?
Program durability is one thing, but 
</p>

<pre class="example">
existing code is used to solve the problem / existing code is capable of solving the problem

<p>
Edit distance efficiency, tentatively
</p>

<p>
Is quite another. I'd be interested to see 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>good ways to measure that</li>
<li>good ways to improve it</li>
<li>how DNA performs on that scale.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, reading the deductive uncertainty paper would really help right about now, since it hooks up real nice.

Saying "no" acknowledges the thing you're responding to as having enough weight to be noticed in the first place.
"No" is a transformation that just doesn't survive intact through the transmission and lensing of the collective illusion. This fact is there, buried in the reflexive mistrust of protest, in the invitation to suspicion being inescapably double-edged as a rhetorical tool&#x2026;"no" invites pruning, it invites criticality and logic, 
the exercise of reasoning over priors, and being the purest, most effective tool for the generation of powerful (useful, correct, effective, unpredicatable, unsimulable, fearsome) ideas that we have, is therefore much, <i>much</i> cheaper for an individual, and less risky, than it could ever be for a society.
The mechanism of taboo, therefore, functions as an attempt at inoculation. It's an act of name-stealing, or dilution, of confusion. If you want certain things not to be thought, these roundabout mechanisms are all that you could hope to see working.

Leaf in the middle and glass on the left<br />
(You eat with your right hand and ought to sip water<br />
Though everybody disagrees on just how and when)<br />
Salt isn't asked about, sweet's always yes<br />
The rest of it, you can try to say yes or no<br />
And there's rules about everything that you won't know<br />
But the grandmother next to you (grandfather's at<br />
The head of the table, and we wait for him to eat)<br />
Will make sure you follow them and explain if she's nice.<br />
You're lost, and you'd drown, without this advice.<br />
Later, when you realize that they laughed when you sprinkled<br />
The water round your plate like you'd seen them all do<br />
Because imitation doesn't work when the rule's just for you<br />
And your grandmother's in the kitchen, eating after she serves<br />
Not how the only girl child of her generation would<br />
If she could be quiet, and appear to be good.<br />
When the womenfolk eat, I lay out their food<br />
The salt and the sweet and all of the rest<br />
And they say yes or no based on what they like best.<br />
