</p><p>Because heterotopia is the study of models that interact with what they model.
</p><p>An unreal space that represents (operates upon? resolves?) the real space and causes things to happen in the real space. How and why? Because it is perceived by what it represents or resolves. Like a mirror, like a honeymoon suite, like a prison.
</p><p>I&#x27;m looking for ways that participants perceive and change the mechanisms to which they are subject.
</p><p>Can a highest-bidder auction change to a Vickrey auction by the actions of the bidders? How does one model the act of changing a mechanism one is participating in? What are the incentives involved?
</p><p>The decision to change a mechanism that you&#x27;re participating in needs to operate by its own mechanism - a vote to change, for example, like is formally done in legislative councils.
</p><p>It needs to take into account the expected behaviours of co-players.
