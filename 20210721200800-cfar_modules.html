</p><blockquote><p>Most of our participants, though, find that there is a lot of opportunity for gain from systemization. Try mentally running through the following domains, looking for things that snag or require effort or are annoying or consume a lot of attention:
Common routines
• Waking up: Dealing with the alarm, using the bathroom or shower, getting dressed, gathering the things you need for the day
• Meals: Deciding what to eat (and when), shopping, budgeting, taking care of dishes and leftovers
• Work: Commute, getting settled, parts of your job that tend to be the same week in and week out
• Computer: Startup, tab and window management, sites that you routinely visit and programs that you regularly use
• Social: Connecting with friends, planning get-togethers, using email and Facebook and other social media
Familiar spaces
• Bedroom: laundry, clutter, lighting, temperature, floor space, outlets
• Bathroom: shower supplies, drawers/medicine cabinet, toilet paper, towels, toothbrush/shaving
• Kitchen: sink/dishwasher, cabinets, pantry, fridge, pots/pans/utensils
• Living room: furniture, blankets/pillows, bookshelves, entertainment system, plants, carpet
• Vehicle: electronics, music, trash/clutter, seats, storage
• Workspace: desk, chair, computer, outlets, food
• Bag/briefcase/backpack: weight, organization, clutter
Shoulds and obligations
• Physical health: eating habits, exercise, medical issues, rest
• Financial well-being: banking, budgeting, investments
• Intellectual growth: reading, problem solving, formal education
• Close relationships: family, friends, loved ones, colleagues
• Career: work/life balance, projects, job changes
• Emotional well-being: hobbies, sleep, communication and support
• Community: volunteering, church/school/club obligations, neighborhood events
