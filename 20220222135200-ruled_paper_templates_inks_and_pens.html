</p><p>Personally, I print different rulings onto printer paper all the time, just for the versatility and cheapness of printer paper compared to other papers like Rhodia and Clairfontaine.
</p><p>For all those out there that also want to print different rulings onto their papers, I’ve created a bunch of “ready-to-print” sheets of paper with a bunch of different rulings and spacings. Each PDF file below contains a two-sided “ready-to-print” document with the same ruling on both sides of the paper. I have included the popular US Letter size (8.5” x 11”) and the European A4 size (21cm x 29.7cm).
</p><p>All templates have light gray lines with a border on the left and right sides of 0.3mm.
