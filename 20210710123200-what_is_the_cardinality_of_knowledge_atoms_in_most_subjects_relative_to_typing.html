</p><p>Knowledge atoms in typing are <em>key-emes</em>, ie keypress-output pairs, or keypress-fingering-output triples. These compose into chunks of sequential presses that themselves grow to attach to context in their own right.
</p><p>Other forms of knowledge probably undergo the same superadditive chunking-caching, if we&#x27;re interpreting LHTL on <a href="id:1866ea0f-902d-4c1e-a581-165475cbc068">chunking</a> correctly (which I think we are). But is the relationship between the chunks and their components the same? For one thing, is the ratio of one to the other the same (number of key-emes in a word, number of common key-eme patterns in a word)?
</p><p>Theory: <a href="/stenography#stenography">stenography</a> improves upon this tradeoff in particular, with the compositionality stuff.
