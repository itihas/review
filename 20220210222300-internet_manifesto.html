It&#x27;s like having access to 1,000,000x the Library of Alexandria every day, and only being interested in keeping up with what people are talking about in the lobby.
</p><p>The internet used to be:
a place for creative expression
vastly customizable
a space for people, by people
The internet has become:
a marketplace (and we are the product)
a one-sided social experience
a capitalist hellscape
We, the people of the internet, have the power to transform the internet.
The goal is not to go backwards, but to forge a new path forward.
