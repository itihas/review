Solving economics is just a matter of allocating resources to people in the most efficient possible way, right? What happens if you try to do that?
</p><p>This result proves that at least one reasonable-seeming way to model that situation is a dead-end.
</p><p>Properties of the model:
</p><ul><li><p>Universality - allocation function is complete of the space of resources and people&#x27; preferences
</p></li><li><p>Pareto-optimality - all possible Pareto improvements are made: that is, allocations A where there exists no allocations A&#x27; that are preferred by at least one person and equivelently good per everybody else.
</p></li><li><p>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives or i.i.d) - people&#x27;s preferences are consistent across the subset relation - if <span class="math math-inline">R = P_Alice({A,B}) = A &gt;= B</span>,  then for all <span class="math math-inline">\phi</span>, <span class="math math-inline">R&#x27; = P_Alice({A,B} \bigcup \phi)</span> must be such that <span class="math math-inline">A R_2 B</span> is <span class="math math-inline">A &gt;= B</span>.
</p></li><li><p>(No) Dictatorship - No single person in the allocation function is empowered to &quot;choose among allocations&quot; - that is, there should be no person whose preferences completely determine the entire allocation function.
</p></li></ul><p>There exist no allocation functions with all four of these properties.
