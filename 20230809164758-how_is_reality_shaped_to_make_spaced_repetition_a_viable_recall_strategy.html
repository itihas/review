</p><p>Hypothesis: exponential decay (the forgetting curve) is the time-discounted utility of information to a humanlike agent.
Hypothesis: the forgetting curve is optimized as part of the design of collective memory: it represents the RTT for a memetically fit piece of information to come back around to you after making the rounds of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&#x27;s number</a> tribe.
</p><p>I&#x27;m basically asking: Why is the brain designed like that?
