I struggle to say what I mean here - I didn&#x27;t read unreflectively, because it wasn&#x27;t easy at first. I didn&#x27;t read forgetfully or without being affected, because I remember rereading as central to the experience - poring, caressing words on the page and in my mind, meditating in a way that felt like the feel of paper under my fingers. It could come closer to the point to say that I read the way one speaks a language - naturally, whatever that means. Guided by instinct and taste. Whatever I was reading taught me to read.
</p><p>It occurred to me today (<span class="timestamp">[2024-08-29 Thu]</span> ) that I had a skill I haven&#x27;t been using or some time - of creatinga space for the thing I was reading in my mind where it didn&#x27;t quite have to touch eveyrthing else in my mind just yet. I have in recent years been having trouble with managing the opening of questions as I read - branching-off thoughts that all feel precious, beautiful, drugging - but the problem is of <span class="underline" style="text-decoration:underline">serialising</span> these into an experience that lets me be <a href="/are_you_serious_by_visakan_veerasamy">serious</a> about the reading and the thinking both. We run once more into the problem of <a href="/20240829215940-tsundoku">budget</a> - it is impossible to do everything that you could do before you die. And it turns out, waiting in the back halls of my mind for me to remember it again was a skill I had already bult, back before the skillset was something I ever needed to make legible for myself: of holding the fear carefully within my field of vision, and responding to it with a superficially paradoxical response - <em>not yet</em>.
</p><p>These things - skills and legibility, form and weight - come in cycles. Reading is a much weightier activity these days than it was when I was a child. Back then I had the luxury of rewriting myself whenever I felt like it, because I hadn&#x27;t done much writing of self yet. Everything was illegible, everything was a mystery to come to fresh. What used to be easy will now take some bravery to do. But as I&#x27;ve built the muscle to weild the tool, the old skill has come back, and with it the ability to describe what it is I&#x27;m doing.
</p><p>It&#x27;s generally much harder to describe what it is you&#x27;re doing than to do it: the nature of fiction is a good example. SEP has a good section on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fiction/#FictAuthPret">authorial pretense</a>, where they try to work through how to characterise the space in which fiction occurs. Urslua K Le Guin has a  <a href="/20221101155800-uklg_comment_about_absolute_belief_coexisting_with_knowledge_that_one_has_no_reason_to_believe_and_many_to_disbelieve_is_weirdly_useful_for_a_textbook_also">suitably paradoxical characterisation of suspension of disbelief</a> that begins with the status of writing as <em>art</em>, from which premise the double nature of communication through writing follows more neatly than you&#x27;d expect.
</p><p>Why does talking to other people change me? Why does reading change me? There are thin and thick answers. Thinly, because I&#x27;m a social animal - I&#x27;m built to be changed by what I&#x27;m given to understand. The thick answer is a work in progress, and the work consists of elaborating that sentence.
