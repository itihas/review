</p><p>Alternating-time temporal logic is a logic which can express whether the coordinated action of a coalition of agents can enforce a given property of play. This is expressed as players navigating a state space to reach a state from which no futures that violate the property can be reached.
</p><p>A sentence in alternating-time temporal logic is structured as follows:
</p><p>&lt;coalition c&gt; can force &lt;LTL claim L&gt; 
</p><p>Which plays out semantically as
</p><p>there exists a partial strategy <!-- -->σ<!-- --> consisting only of moves by members of c, such that for every state s&#x27; that <!-- -->σ<!-- --> potentially reaches from the current state s, all histories beginning from s&#x27; obey L.
</p><p>ATL is modeled by concurrent game systems. It is satisfiable in PTIME. There exist variants, notably ATL*, which are only satisfiable in 2EXPTIME.
</p><p>The &quot;alternation&quot; desrcibes the proof strategy, which shows that given a specific coalition and a specific outcome they are trying to force, if there exists a coalitional strategy to force that outcome it can be found by treating the game as a 2-player game between the coalition and its complement and using more typical <a href="/20230816195955-backwards_induction_reasoning">BIR</a> from there.
</p><h1 id="from-wikipedia">from wikipedia</h1><blockquote><p>In computer science, Alternating-time Temporal Logic, or ATL, is a branching-time temporal logic that naturally describes computations of multi-agent system and multiplayer games. It offers selective quantification over program-paths that are possible outcomes of games. ATL uses alternating-time formulas to construct model-checkers in order to address problems such as receptiveness, realizability, and controllability.
