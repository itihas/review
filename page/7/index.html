    <li><h3>A Dystopian Story</h3><a href="http://itihas.review/writing/a-dystopian-story/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span><br /><p>&ldquo;Put that cheapot down, Helen.&rdquo;<br />
At the sound of the high-pitched voice, with its imperious tone, Helen
jumped so badly that the cornflower-blue teapot nearly fell out of her
hands. With hands still shaking, she slotted the teapot back into its
hexagonal niche in the wall, and the pneumatic door slid closed in front
of it almost before she could withdraw her hands again.<br />
Helen&rsquo;s daughter stood crossly in the doorway, hands on hips.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of that filthy old thing yet. In
fact, I think I will tomorrow.&rdquo;<br />
With a gusty sigh (made somewhat less impressive by her tiny lung
capacity), Helen&rsquo;s daughter skipped across the room towards the large
plush purple beanbag in the center.<br />
&ldquo;Daughter, no, please, please don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;<br />
The small child spun on her heel to face Helen, and stomped her foot.
She pressed a button on the remote control dangling from her wrist, and
Helen had to grit her teeth to hold back the scream. Helen always had to
be careful about her screams when she was punished - some children liked
them, she knew from the Manual, but not her daughter.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t *argue*with me.&rdquo;<br />
Helen knew she wasn&rsquo;t really that angry - she had remembered to spin on
her heel and stomp her foot, after all. That meant she was doing it for
show. It was only respectable to reprimand a parent for speaking out of
turn, and PurpleLava was eminently respectable.<br />
It was also only respectable to have the teapot vaporized if she
expressed a wish to preserve it. It broke just about every rule of
respectability in this enlightened era to preserve an object established
as old, on the entreaties of a <em>parent</em>. Helen knew it was hopeless,
could feel it in her aching spine. Still, she had to give it a try.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, daughter. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, should I have?&rdquo;<br />
Helen&rsquo;s daughter calmed.<br />
&ldquo;No, you shouldn&rsquo;t have. But that&rsquo;s okay, if you know that.&rdquo; She
fidgeted with the pin-and-purple plastic beads on her wrist. &ldquo;Why should
I keep it, anyway?&rdquo;<br />
Helen smiled. She knew she was much better off than most parents were in
their homes, with a daughter like hers. PurpleLava (that was the name
she had most recently picked for herself, and the folks at the
Development Centre said that it was a sign of an out-of-the-box,
progressive bent of mind) was on her way to being a Scientist. That made
her more open-minded to ideas that Helen put forward, even if they were
by definition backward ideas, coming from a parent.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curiosity. It&rsquo;s not something that you see everyday, is it? Even
if it is filthy and old.&rdquo;<br />
PurpleLava rolled her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>boring</em> curiosity. It was invented
how long ago? It doesn&rsquo;t matter at <em>all</em>.&rdquo; She scoffed. &ldquo;What kind of a
name is cheapot for a curiosity, anyway?&rdquo;<br />
Helen tensed; she had to pick her words yet more carefully. &ldquo;Yes, but
nobody in the latest generation has looked at it yet. It&rsquo;s so old, it&rsquo;s
almost a natural object, isn&rsquo;t it? So maybe you could see something in
it that people couldn&rsquo;t before. And you can always rename it.&rdquo;<br />
PurpleLava considered this, her thumb in her mouth. Then she took it out
and nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not <em>such</em> a bad idea. Even if it is filthy and old,
I guess I could look at it a bit before we vaporize it.&rdquo;<br />
Helen nearly collapsed with relief. It would be months before the
question of the filthy old thing in the wall occurred to her daughter
again. Until then, the teapot was safe. With shaking fingers, she pushed
the button to close the receptacle. It slid shut with a pneumatic
hiss.<br />
PurpleLava was already skipping off, headed for her home lab. She had
already lost interest.<br />
Helen would have been a Scientist in her day - but there was a genetic
weakness in her mother&rsquo;s side, and she came down with a disease when
they were children. Helen had been quarantined for three years, and
hadn&rsquo;t been able to attend the Development Centre at the right ages. She
had stayed at home spending more time alone with her mother than was
considered healthy for a modern progressive child.<br />
Her mother had been a foreigner, and she had had a number of filthy old
things with her. One by one, Helen had had them vaporized - they weren&rsquo;t
respectable in the slightest, and her visiting colleagues would have
found them disgusting - but once she started staying at home, she did
this less and less; and the last one, the teapot, was left until after
her mother turned forty, and she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to get rid of
it.<br />
She hadn&rsquo;t always been called Helen. She had been GreenPony, and Starry,
and SunsetButterfly, but had eventually changed her name to what her
mother had always called her. No one knew what it meant, but Helen was
sure it was old. PurpleLava didn&rsquo;t like people to know that it came from
Helen&rsquo;s parent - a parent&rsquo;s parent, a thought vaguely nauseating in
itself. It was a serious embarrassment to her. Helen was often punished
for it when PurpleLava was in a bad mood, but parent names weren&rsquo;t that
important anyway, so none of her colleagues ever found out, and Helen
was allowed to keep it.<br />
Fingering the bruised skin around the electrode at the back of her neck,
Helen wondered what PurpleLava would say if she knew that Helen still
sometimes used the word mother in her head.<br />
She also wondered if Purple Lava knew what the teapot was made out of.
Probably not - she had never even touched the teapot before, and she
hadn&rsquo;t seen the stuff before either. Helen tasted on her tongue that
foreign idea, the idea that she knew something her daughter didn&rsquo;t. It
wasn&rsquo;t a new idea to her. After all, she knew because her mother had
told her.<br />
What it was was something called tchina. Her mother had owned a lot of
the stuff. If it broke, the pieces would be sharp.</p>

<p>Helen turned the idea over and under in her mind, considering.</p>

    <li><h3>Look what the cat dragged in.</h3><a href="http://itihas.review/writing/look-what-the-cat-dragged-in/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span><br /><p>&ldquo;But I love you,&rdquo; he pleads, eyes streaming and voice shaking; a mess of
quaking limbs and blotched skin, dressed in dirty thirdhand rags and
alley-cat hair, on his knees on the expensive carpet I had had selected
and arranged just last week. I sniff, disgusted. Does he honestly expect
his snivelling to make any difference to me? One would have thought he’d
know better by now at least.</p>

<p>Gingerly, I brush at a trailing, fraying bit of cloth with a foot. I’m not even sure it belongs to any garment
– it seems perfectly possible that he fished it out of the gutter
outside a tailor shop.I
try to lift rather than press at it – I don&rsquo;t want to riskdamaging the
carpet any more than he has already. It’s likely beyond repair, but one hasto
show at least that modicum of
consideration.</p>

<p>I’m quick enough to pull away before he catches my leg, thankfully. I
just finished getting myself in order and presentable five minutes ago,
and heaven only knows what kind of destruction he could wreak on my coat
with those filthy hands. The lunge he makes towards me is pitifully
weak, but it’s enough to topple him over; he could be made of wire and
gelatin, all quivers and stiff joints. He lies, sobbing, with his cheek
pressed to the shag pile. He tries and fails to lever himself up again,
and sobs some more. I sigh a little.</p>

<p>A glance at one of the servicemen standing in the background is enough.
They know what’s needed, and will handle it without my needing to
trouble myself one whit more than I have already. I give the heap on the
ground a last look before turning towards the balcony. It’s the only
place in the house where I can be assured of escaping his <em>stink</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice night. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to disturb myself, when I could
otherwise spend the time enjoying it. The air is balmy, the smell of the
sea is coming in from the slight, warm breeze; the lights twinkle above
and below – flickering pinpricks like dust in the sky, and the more
vulgar multicoloured flashes shining up from the spread of land below.
The lights climb the low hills to the south. They look like bleeding
fingers, metrically lit avenue-strips leaking pools of muted rainbows.
It appeals to the nouveau riche aesthetic, I suppose. I’ve been there,
but never lived there. I wouldn’t want to; for all their vulgar sprawl,
those estates make me claustrophobic.</p>

<p>For myself, I prefer to be <em>in</em> town,
not those suburban excuses for
city life.I’m placed directly at the
nerve-centre of the network of lights, but elevated to remoteness from
it; prized territory rather than profligate. It’s well decorated and
cosy, with nooks to hole away in and oversize cushions for naps. The art
is bold and abstract. The furnishings are Art Deco. The colours are
soothing. I pay for comfort, and I pay for taste.</p>

<p>I watch now, perched on the wide railing, as the even patterns shift and
dim. It’s late, for night-blind folks.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s pushed onto the deck through the French windows; they close
silently behind him. I look him over sidelong, unwilling to displace
myself excessively and slightly afraid he’s still in that obscene state
he arrived in. As expected, however, all is well. He&rsquo;s clean, hair
washed and combed, in a cotton shirt and silk slacks, shod in the
smooth, buttery-soft house moccasins set aside for him. Sweet, generic
gardenia perfume wafts its way to my nose. While the cringing expression
and stance is annoying, it takes low priority. I beckon him closer
lazily. Thankfully he&rsquo;s unable to find anything to trip over in the
expanse of empty, sanded wood between us.</p>

<p>He stands awkwardly over me. The silence stretches. He never can handle
much of it. Practice has given him about a minute&rsquo;s worth of liver, and
then, on cue, he snaps.</p>

<p>“Princess. Princess.” he looks at me, desperate. I can read it in his
eyes, the panic that prey undergo when they realize they&rsquo;re trapped –
nothing worth doing, and yet they struggle, blindly, because their
brains tell them to. He has to say something, but he doesn&rsquo;t even
realize what&rsquo;s coming out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Look at me, princess. Won&rsquo;t you believe me? Why won&rsquo;t you believe me?
Princess, I love you, I love you so much. Isn&rsquo;t that enough for you? You
said it was, you did, you did. Princess, look at me—”</p>

<p>His pupils crowd his irises out of the way. He&rsquo;s talking without pause
for breath, but cuts himself off as I open my mouth. More fool him – I’m
only yawning. He watches me, and I can see the threads unravelling from
his mind as the situation truly sets in and he realizes where he is,
what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>“Come with me, Princess. You said you would. You said you would you said
you would you said you would you—” a gurgle of sorts interrupts his
litany in his sort. He&rsquo;s collapsed, sobbing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually somewhat amusing, in one light. What does he expect me to
do?</p>

<p>I sigh. The balcony is no longer silent, and I abandon what slim hopes I
had of salvaging some part of my nice quiet night. I hop down and
saunter past him, close enough to cross his shadow – just to spook him
some more, for the fun of it. He starts violently away, tipping over
<em>again</em>;and lies trembling as
he follows me out with his fixed prey-stare.</p>

<p>The door is opened for me. As I pass through, a soft, delicate hand
travels along my back, nape to tailbone, in one smooth stroke. I stretch
into the touch, pleased; my head curves back to glance archly at the
demure black-and-white figure.</p>

<p>She used to be dressed in cotton and lace once upon a time, when the old
steamboat was alive. Now she’s in silk, from her fair, bare silky hair
to the toes of her soundless, spotless black ballet flats. My orders, of
course.</p>

<p>It was the steamboat, in her ticklish feathers and nubby, itchy velvets,
who left me all this. She won it all from her old mate, of course, but
that was far before my time.</p>

<p>Idiot lady. Somewhere she had told somebody
that the house and the moneywent to either me or her new mate, whichever
stayed in the house with her corpse for thirty days. The fool sitting
outside hadn’t made it a week before running. I think it must have
broken him a little bit, inside his head.</p>

<p>Milk-boned twit. It hadn’t exactly
been easy for me either. Three days in, and the smell was on everything.
It made me *ravenous.*Still
does whenever I think about it.</p>

<p>It took a week after the carcass left
– minus a few nibbles, and who could blame me? – but my peteventually madeit so you’d think you were in an edelweiss
field fourthousand foot square, right in the middle of
the city. I had had about five
minutes to enjoy it – the last of the old upholstery had just gone out
the door when this fool had
tried to let himself in, and
his reek with him.</p>

<p>“We’ll throw him out, my sweet. Don’t you worry.” She massages my back
some more, her long fingers exactly the trick for my sore nerves. We’ve
never needed words between us, my pet and I; she’s mother and lover and
attendant. She knows what I need.</p>

<p>She clucks now, the sound musical in
her throat. “The hag had terrible taste in some things, didn’t she, sweet? What she saw in this fool to *marry*I’ll never know. And to think he still had a key!I took it, of course, but we’ll need the
locks changed anyway.”</p>

<p>She looks at me, indulgent. “And to
think he wanted to make off with you. But you’d never look twice at that
mangy upstart alley
lurker, would you, Princess. He
never made you turn a hair.”</p>

<p>I feel her smile in her fingers, more
than I see it. She picks me up, holds me against her soft silk-screened
bosom. Her fingertips tease behind my ears. “Why don’t we make a show of
it, and have him dragged out by his shirt tails?” Her voice is musical, soft. It has
none of the screechy
pitches of the idiot outside,
and none of the overloudboom that the steamboat’s had
possessed.</p>

<p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,
Princess? And I suspect I
would, too.” She laughs, low
and throaty, at her own
joke.</p>

<p>I purr again, long and loud, in counterpoint.</p>

    <li><h3>An Evil Prompter</h3><a href="http://itihas.review/writing/an-evil-prompter/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span><br /><p>Who is the person holding the cue cards<br />
and what does he want today?<br />
Sleep ran off with Night, so I drank with First Light<br />
She washed all my lines away<br />
Sometimes they&rsquo;re blank, and sometimes they&rsquo;re written<br />
in languages I never learned<br />
Sometimes he&rsquo;s filled them with absolute nonsense<br />
And sometimes he&rsquo;s holding them turned</p>

<p>Who is the person holding the cue cards<br />
and what does he want with me?<br />
We&rsquo;ve never met, and we&rsquo;ve never spoken<br />
So why can&rsquo;t he leave me be?<br />
Everyone sees him, but don&rsquo;t seem to notice<br />
It&rsquo;s me that they&rsquo;re looking at funny<br />
Is he Somebody&rsquo;s nephew or Somebody&rsquo;s boyfriend?<br />
Is Somebody taking his Money?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s driving me to my limit<br />
It&rsquo;s time to get out of this business<br />
I fail to see what&rsquo;s in it<br />
For me anymore</p>

<p>Wave me goodbye and kiss me<br />
Lie to my face that you&rsquo;ll miss me<br />
As you were, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re busy<br />
I know the way to the door</p>
