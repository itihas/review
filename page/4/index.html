    <li><h3>Myth</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/myth/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>To what extent does what we hear about the world shape the way we speak
to it? All our lives we’re fed fantasies of the perfect partner, the
other half, the feelings of incompleteness that will not manifest until
their resolution is immediately present; the problems that you didn’t
know existed until their solution was manifest. This gross appropriation
on the part of love of every other myth one can find oneself immersed in
is nothing short of criminal at times. The currency of the myths is the
intangible and unknown; truths about oneself hidden even from oneself.
In a world where love has, like a destructive parasite to a host,
appropriated all the resources of the soul, that ought to be available
to fuel heroism, martyrdom, rebellion, psychosis, freedom, identity,
thought, art – in such a world, I have no interest, but I am afraid of
it.</p>

<p>Love and romance make poor candidates for the only myths in the world.
Romance, in its flush, exists before love is made concrete. Other myths
need to carry it forward, or love will die. And if love itself is
thought to be myth, unreliable and yet reliant on faith – in such a
world, romance, seemingly safer, is the sole refuge of the weary heart,
and its final traitor. Like clockwork, the same tired motions and
mechanics do little but mark time for the weary souls serving as cogs
and hands and cuckoos. Myths are cyclic, but they need to convince; one
cannot begin the circuit already weary at the thought of its end.</p>

<p>To that end, we were lucky. We were young. Our bones were limber, and
hadn&rsquo;t ground down with a thousand repeated strains of one pattern. We
simply hadn&rsquo;t yet had the time to do them injury.</p>

<p>But our myth was neither love nor romance. It was rebellion.</p>

    <li><h3>Exposition</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/exposition/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>She was pretty. She knew it, too, and
used it shamelessly to her advantage whenever she thought it would give
her the slightest edge in anything. Her face was well enough structured,
but it was her skin, pale and creamy and only ever charmingly blemished,
that did it for her; that and the way she used her face, the
expressions. She was petite but healthy-bodied. She attracted attention,
but not stares. She smiled often, and had a repertoire of smiles, one
for every occasion and desired outcome.</p>

<p>Socially speaking, her one perhaps
redeemable feature was her temper; it blazed at the slightest annoyance,
and gave her scowls; but died down just as fast. She refused to be
embarrassed by it, and carried on blithely once any issue it caused was
resolved. Whatever her other virtues and failings, it was this for which
people liked her, because it made her both imperfect and nonthreatening.
There is nothing as toothless as an easily appeased temperament.</p>

<p>She was only ever truly beautiful when she danced.</p>

<p>It was what I loved her for.</p>

<p>The first time I saw her was in a group
of five. The occasion was meaningless, one of the many half-baked
internal - “inter-house” – events foisted on our free time for the sake
of generating the facsimile of a diverse almanac that the institute
presented prospectives with. The performance was pitiful, really, with
the steps repetitive and exaggerated, and all the dancers out of step to
the point where one wondered if they were even performing the same
routine. Front and centre, put there to bolster the overall appearance
and remind the others of what they were doing, she stood giving life
even to those dull motions. Enthusiasm formed the basis for why their
group won; the other dancers&rsquo; as well, I suppose, but mostly her own.
She seemed to take up the entirety of the pitiful stage, tiny as she was
physically. The other dancers were little more than flawed extensions of
her presence.</p>

<p>That magnified personality was the first
hint I had of her possessing any character to speak of.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much unusual, though; just a
moment of reflection that betrayed her being human. Character is the
property of not being superfluous to a story – any story – worth being
written, and stories are forgiving things; by this measure you would be
hard pressed to find someone without an ounce of character to speak of
over the course of their lives and pasts and deaths. This was simply the
moment where I realized she was worth my interest; an epistemic
phenomenon purely. The first moment where I could decisively say she
interested me came much later; how it came about, though, causally or
chronologically, seems both perfectly obvious and utterly shrouded in
mystery.</p>

<p>We were friends, or were defined as such
in the social structure of our surroundings, almost from the first day.
In my mind at that time, she was only someone I spoke to. It was a
matter of circumstance – or at least, not fully relevant – that I spoke
to perhaps three people out of a hundred-odd in my immediate
environment, and seven in the extended; not counting those with whom
communication was unavoidable but mercifully scripted. She bored me much
of the time, but possessed flashes of insight into matters that honestly
interested her, as opposed to the many things she did for the sake of
being able to say she had done it, or for the sake of impressing or
ingratiating herself with the others.</p>

<p>“Maths?” she&rsquo;d say. “I love the subject.
You can get a hundred in maths.” I would roll my eyes, and she would
look at me sidelong. “Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re so much above all of this
marks bullshit. You care about it more than most of these idiots.” And I
did care, much as I tried to hide it: whatever anybody said they hated
in public, they wanted in private. She was perceptive because her world
was made of these sorts of absolutes.</p>

<p>Everyone wanted to be better. The best
wanted to be better at something else. Work was always the last resort.
Being nice avoided trouble. Slightly dim girls were endearing and got
treated well. Whatever it was one wanted to accomplish, there was always
someone somewhere willing to strike a deal that would accomplish it for
you.</p>

<p>Some of these were reflective, and some
were algorithmic. It was rare that she found herself wrong, because she
constructed and applied her rules very well. She was generally thought
smart, but by her own design she appeared much less intelligent than she
was.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I did talk to her quite a
lot, even in those early days. Her own insecurity and mine centred many
of our conversations on why and how precisely we enjoyed each other. We
shared every detail of our lives and histories, in a passive-aggressive
bid to outdo each other in the levels of pathos and anger we could
manufacture from them.</p>

<p>“I hate my father so much.”</p>

<p>“Me too. He should just leave the house
already. My mother has spent half her life completely miserable because
of him. I don&rsquo;t get why he doesn&rsquo;t just <em>leave</em>.”</p>

<p>“You haven&rsquo;t seen the half of it. Thank
God mine isn&rsquo;t home right now. The things he used to&hellip;ugh, I can&rsquo;t even
think about it without feeling like screaming.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>I seized upon whatever dregs of
empathetic feeling I could find in myself to try and justify my
curiosity; the moment, the unfamiliar flavours of falseness, remain
vivid in my mind. She was looking for it; she was in a boasting mood,
after all, and how without an audience ready to eat out of her hand? She
would pause for a moment, perfectly timed, as she bit her lip in a show
of nervousness. You would feel by the way she looked at you as if you
were in her deepest confidence; and yet I had heard the same spiel given
to others: different context, different content, same beats. With other
people, it would be others&rsquo; secrets she would share. She had a measure
of trust in my closed mouth, because who would I open it to?</p>

<p>I loved to play her game, because she
elevated it to an art form.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t say where among these million small processes and occurrences
I began to observe as closely as I did; or when within that observation,
I began to be fascinated. In hindsight, situation and circumstance made
it perfectly obvious, a given even, what was going to happen. But if I
were to attempt a causal map, a true recount of the hows and wherefores
of our outcome, I would find myself unmoored. For concrete events I have
only one true instance I can point to, and that was the moment, that
unbearable, forceful moment crystalline in my memory; when, on an
interminable bus ride back to the campus from some unimportant
competition, she touched the tips of her fingers to pointed toes on an
outstretched leg, gracefully, showily loosening her cramped limbs across
the empty aisle. Her hair fell forward across her shoulders and onto her
knees, curls at the nape sticking there with sweat; the pleats of her
skirt fanned out, hanging just above the floor; her eyes, large and
direct, were focused on her pointed shoe; and her bare shin was laid out
at waist level, square in my field of vision. The airless interior
became vacuum to my lungs, and I realized I was obsessed.</p>

    <li><h3>Preludes</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/preludes/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>The problem with the world today is a lack of destruction.</p>

<p>I say this despite knowing that most will find the notion perfectly
counterintuitive – and that&rsquo;s the problem: we have come to a place, in
our collective psyche, where we find the necessity of destruction
counterintuitive. This is far from a natural or healthy state.</p>

<p>Humans aren&rsquo;t born with respect for only creative or preservative
processes; we&rsquo;re born without the barriers that tell us not to pull
things down, to tear them apart, to kill them or crush them or stomp on
them. They are inverse twins, creation and destruction, that build
cycles that hold eternal fascination and infinite beauty for our minds;
it is a beauty we learn before we are old enough or slow enough to be
properly taught anything. You see it in children: blocks are used to
create the most elaborate, storied constructions, as tall as their
makers, which are really only built so they can be torn down again –
fists are punched through their centres, cornerstones are pulled away,
and small palms are clapped in glee as the castle comes crashing to the
ground. (“Building blocks.”) The pattern is ubiquitous to all childhood:
Sand castles slaved over for hours get kicked up when the tides come in.
Girls&rsquo; pigtails get pulled. Low tables get turned over. Milk gets
spilled. Knees and hands are torn up in efforts to run as fast as legs
can carry you. Childhood, after all, is the passionate pursuit of
entropy, through any and all means. Nothing in childhood is ever
repeated. Nothing acquires that dull, comfortable sheen of sameness to
other things that characterises our every attitude towards the world as
adults. The best agents of entropy are creation and destruction, and we
find their dichotomy everywhere in the exercise of children&rsquo;s agency.</p>

<p>The structures we are taught to think in, on the other hand, rely on
sameness. We reduce all thinking to the manipulation of it, kill the
openness of our minds with grey walls of abstraction to fence all our
experiences; we build entire cities of invariant boxes that claim,
laughably, to represent what they contain. We give them the
contemptible, paradoxical moniker of &lsquo;systems of thought&rsquo;; and posit
with desperate conviction their sufficiency for all human activity; and
invent new ones to hide behind whenever the whisper of truth reveals to
us the converse. Language. Logic. Science. Politics.</p>

<p>Inexorably, inevitably, piece by required piece, we become so reliant on
these grey walls and the mountainous, intractable structures they&rsquo;ve
been assembled into, that we lose sense of what they are and what we
are. Like fools, we call their mess, their senseless profusion, the same
names we had for the glorious, ephemeral beauties of things we last
properly saw too long ago to remember; equality becomes our stand-in for
diversity, war becomes our stand-in for battle, monument becomes our
stand-in for art. We mistake complexity, and scale beyond comprehension,
for entropy; and proceed to spend our life adding to it in some effort
to replicate the effortless feeling of childhood, when everything was
madness, madness that words couldn&rsquo;t pin down and that no one else could
ever see.</p>

<p>But we are, against our best efforts, still human, and our inherences
don&rsquo;t change; and we still love what we learned to love before we were
taught anything, to tear things down. It is impossible in the world we
created, and unthinkable to tear the world down. So we compartmentalize
and rationalize the love away, trying to lose it in structure so that we
don&rsquo;t have to look at it straight. We call it the cost of change, we
call it a perverse urge, we call it rage, we call it stress, we call it
progress. We call it genius or psychosis in others so we can pretend not
to understand. We try to medicate it away. We try to find acceptable
targets for it, and acceptable ways to indulge it. We try to relegate it
to other places a thousand miles distant, miles measured over oceans and
mountains and lines on maps, so we can tut at it like pigeons and
pretend to be powerless about its effects.</p>

<p>There are those of us who enjoy watching this structure and these people
as they tick forward by degrees into their own destruction; against
odds, we remember and face our love of falls, of breaks, of violence. We
sit at the edge of the stage, eating popcorn as if we were audience, and
every so often we get up to go among the main players and walk around,
and stroke people&rsquo;s backs to make them shiver, or claw at their cheeks
from behind, and say, “Boo!” so that they jump out of place or forget
their lines. We cackle madly as some corner of the play derails, and the
chances for the production&rsquo;s success grow yet worse.</p>

<p>This is one such stage corner. Some would call it a horror story.</p>
