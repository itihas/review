    <li><h3>Prologue</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/prologue/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>It
was a piece of emptiness that we all drove around - the place where
nothing could be built, nothing could be planted, nothing could <em>happen</em>
that humans could have a hand in. Satellite imaging gave us all we
really knew about the space that we had to skirt, every single day, just
to make it to where we needed to be; that was that it was overgrown, and
that the foliage was darker than that immediately surrounding. Once in a
while, the image on Google Earth was refreshed, and we caught a vague
glimpse of reflected sky piecemealed in brown water. It would stay there
for a month or more, until they took a new picture from up
high.<br />
The
first time I&rsquo;d seen that happen, I&rsquo;d print-screened, not knowing how
else to save the image at the time. Silly, really, the icon was right
there on the toolbar&hellip;but I&rsquo;d just started using the application at the
time, and I&rsquo;d been irrationally panicked, thinking I&rsquo;d lose
it.<br />
We
were told a great deal more about the place. Crescent Lake wasn&rsquo;t much
of a lake anymore; it had eutrophicated some fifty years ago, and was
something akin to marshland now. It was more expensive to drain than
most marshland, because it had a connection to the aquifer that sat
under the town - it took special equipment to keep from polluting it
with half a century&rsquo;s worth of nitrogen buildup and chemical leaching.
Too expensive a project if the mayor&rsquo;s Clean and Green running slogan
were to be kept free from any damaging irony next
election.<br />
We
were also told, on occasion, about young idiots who wandered into the
expanse, and wasted taxpayer money on search parties that had started to
become monotonous for the rest of us to hear about. Local news seemed to
get a great deal of play out of stories that always turned out the same.
Each time it happened, yet more flyers went out to paper the school
walls, talks were given, and vigils were held. The red-eyed parents
could be glimpsed, seated in the front row of the auditorium as people
for whom photo opportunities were a part of life proselytized their
cause under cover of expressing a community&rsquo;s grief. Rules were
tightened, curfews were discussed, talking heads bobbled at each other
about the deeper political meaning of everybody&rsquo;s opinion&rsquo;s and
decisions were made or not made in closed rooms nobody knew much about.
Nothing really happened. Life went on. The hole in reality fell out of
the spotlight, and was not discussed. It wasn&rsquo;t something people wanted
to dwell on.<br />
To
my life, it was essentially background noise; for all that I was one of
those that counted and saw the missing faces. I woke up on time,
exercised, ate a balanced breakfast, packed a balanced lunch, went to
work and came back. I spent absurd amounts of time cooking dinner, ate
it as I reviewed tomorrow&rsquo;s notes a final time, and went to bed reading,
at ten thirty and no later.<br />
The
faces, the details, they faded into the background. I could remember any
of it if I thought about it, but where was the need to?<br />
In
retrospect, it looks a great deal like I was begging for something to go
wrong.</p>

    <li><h3>Myth</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/myth/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>To what extent does what we hear about the world shape the way we speak
to it? All our lives we’re fed fantasies of the perfect partner, the
other half, the feelings of incompleteness that will not manifest until
their resolution is immediately present; the problems that you didn’t
know existed until their solution was manifest. This gross appropriation
on the part of love of every other myth one can find oneself immersed in
is nothing short of criminal at times. The currency of the myths is the
intangible and unknown; truths about oneself hidden even from oneself.
In a world where love has, like a destructive parasite to a host,
appropriated all the resources of the soul, that ought to be available
to fuel heroism, martyrdom, rebellion, psychosis, freedom, identity,
thought, art – in such a world, I have no interest, but I am afraid of
it.</p>

<p>Love and romance make poor candidates for the only myths in the world.
Romance, in its flush, exists before love is made concrete. Other myths
need to carry it forward, or love will die. And if love itself is
thought to be myth, unreliable and yet reliant on faith – in such a
world, romance, seemingly safer, is the sole refuge of the weary heart,
and its final traitor. Like clockwork, the same tired motions and
mechanics do little but mark time for the weary souls serving as cogs
and hands and cuckoos. Myths are cyclic, but they need to convince; one
cannot begin the circuit already weary at the thought of its end.</p>

<p>To that end, we were lucky. We were young. Our bones were limber, and
hadn&rsquo;t ground down with a thousand repeated strains of one pattern. We
simply hadn&rsquo;t yet had the time to do them injury.</p>

<p>But our myth was neither love nor romance. It was rebellion.</p>

    <li><h3>Exposition</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/exposition/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>She was pretty. She knew it, too, and
used it shamelessly to her advantage whenever she thought it would give
her the slightest edge in anything. Her face was well enough structured,
but it was her skin, pale and creamy and only ever charmingly blemished,
that did it for her; that and the way she used her face, the
expressions. She was petite but healthy-bodied. She attracted attention,
but not stares. She smiled often, and had a repertoire of smiles, one
for every occasion and desired outcome.</p>

<p>Socially speaking, her one perhaps
redeemable feature was her temper; it blazed at the slightest annoyance,
and gave her scowls; but died down just as fast. She refused to be
embarrassed by it, and carried on blithely once any issue it caused was
resolved. Whatever her other virtues and failings, it was this for which
people liked her, because it made her both imperfect and nonthreatening.
There is nothing as toothless as an easily appeased temperament.</p>

<p>She was only ever truly beautiful when she danced.</p>

<p>It was what I loved her for.</p>

<p>The first time I saw her was in a group
of five. The occasion was meaningless, one of the many half-baked
internal - “inter-house” – events foisted on our free time for the sake
of generating the facsimile of a diverse almanac that the institute
presented prospectives with. The performance was pitiful, really, with
the steps repetitive and exaggerated, and all the dancers out of step to
the point where one wondered if they were even performing the same
routine. Front and centre, put there to bolster the overall appearance
and remind the others of what they were doing, she stood giving life
even to those dull motions. Enthusiasm formed the basis for why their
group won; the other dancers&rsquo; as well, I suppose, but mostly her own.
She seemed to take up the entirety of the pitiful stage, tiny as she was
physically. The other dancers were little more than flawed extensions of
her presence.</p>

<p>That magnified personality was the first
hint I had of her possessing any character to speak of.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much unusual, though; just a
moment of reflection that betrayed her being human. Character is the
property of not being superfluous to a story – any story – worth being
written, and stories are forgiving things; by this measure you would be
hard pressed to find someone without an ounce of character to speak of
over the course of their lives and pasts and deaths. This was simply the
moment where I realized she was worth my interest; an epistemic
phenomenon purely. The first moment where I could decisively say she
interested me came much later; how it came about, though, causally or
chronologically, seems both perfectly obvious and utterly shrouded in
mystery.</p>

<p>We were friends, or were defined as such
in the social structure of our surroundings, almost from the first day.
In my mind at that time, she was only someone I spoke to. It was a
matter of circumstance – or at least, not fully relevant – that I spoke
to perhaps three people out of a hundred-odd in my immediate
environment, and seven in the extended; not counting those with whom
communication was unavoidable but mercifully scripted. She bored me much
of the time, but possessed flashes of insight into matters that honestly
interested her, as opposed to the many things she did for the sake of
being able to say she had done it, or for the sake of impressing or
ingratiating herself with the others.</p>

<p>“Maths?” she&rsquo;d say. “I love the subject.
You can get a hundred in maths.” I would roll my eyes, and she would
look at me sidelong. “Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re so much above all of this
marks bullshit. You care about it more than most of these idiots.” And I
did care, much as I tried to hide it: whatever anybody said they hated
in public, they wanted in private. She was perceptive because her world
was made of these sorts of absolutes.</p>

<p>Everyone wanted to be better. The best
wanted to be better at something else. Work was always the last resort.
Being nice avoided trouble. Slightly dim girls were endearing and got
treated well. Whatever it was one wanted to accomplish, there was always
someone somewhere willing to strike a deal that would accomplish it for
you.</p>

<p>Some of these were reflective, and some
were algorithmic. It was rare that she found herself wrong, because she
constructed and applied her rules very well. She was generally thought
smart, but by her own design she appeared much less intelligent than she
was.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I did talk to her quite a
lot, even in those early days. Her own insecurity and mine centred many
of our conversations on why and how precisely we enjoyed each other. We
shared every detail of our lives and histories, in a passive-aggressive
bid to outdo each other in the levels of pathos and anger we could
manufacture from them.</p>

<p>“I hate my father so much.”</p>

<p>“Me too. He should just leave the house
already. My mother has spent half her life completely miserable because
of him. I don&rsquo;t get why he doesn&rsquo;t just <em>leave</em>.”</p>

<p>“You haven&rsquo;t seen the half of it. Thank
God mine isn&rsquo;t home right now. The things he used to&hellip;ugh, I can&rsquo;t even
think about it without feeling like screaming.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>I seized upon whatever dregs of
empathetic feeling I could find in myself to try and justify my
curiosity; the moment, the unfamiliar flavours of falseness, remain
vivid in my mind. She was looking for it; she was in a boasting mood,
after all, and how without an audience ready to eat out of her hand? She
would pause for a moment, perfectly timed, as she bit her lip in a show
of nervousness. You would feel by the way she looked at you as if you
were in her deepest confidence; and yet I had heard the same spiel given
to others: different context, different content, same beats. With other
people, it would be others&rsquo; secrets she would share. She had a measure
of trust in my closed mouth, because who would I open it to?</p>

<p>I loved to play her game, because she
elevated it to an art form.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t say where among these million small processes and occurrences
I began to observe as closely as I did; or when within that observation,
I began to be fascinated. In hindsight, situation and circumstance made
it perfectly obvious, a given even, what was going to happen. But if I
were to attempt a causal map, a true recount of the hows and wherefores
of our outcome, I would find myself unmoored. For concrete events I have
only one true instance I can point to, and that was the moment, that
unbearable, forceful moment crystalline in my memory; when, on an
interminable bus ride back to the campus from some unimportant
competition, she touched the tips of her fingers to pointed toes on an
outstretched leg, gracefully, showily loosening her cramped limbs across
the empty aisle. Her hair fell forward across her shoulders and onto her
knees, curls at the nape sticking there with sweat; the pleats of her
skirt fanned out, hanging just above the floor; her eyes, large and
direct, were focused on her pointed shoe; and her bare shin was laid out
at waist level, square in my field of vision. The airless interior
became vacuum to my lungs, and I realized I was obsessed.</p>
