    <li><h3>Conversation</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/conversation/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>“Conversations always end too soon for
me.”</p>

<p>“Do
they now.”</p>

<p>I
chewed on my lip, trying to frame my answer. “Either it&rsquo;s awesome, it&rsquo;s
working, and the other person says it&rsquo;s over out of the blue, or it just
peters off, and I don&rsquo;t know where it went.” No, that wasn&rsquo;t right.
“It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re silent, more that it stops working like it
was.”</p>

<p>He
seemed perfectly content to stand where he was, looking at me or through
me as we went on. “You make it sound like a machine.”</p>

<p>“Conversations? Yeah. Lots of delicate
little bits that go in very specific places.”</p>

<p>“And
a lot to get wrong.”</p>

<p>I
twisted a corner of my mouth. “Yeah. That&rsquo;s where the problem is. It&rsquo;s
like everybody I talk to works with only half the blueprint I&rsquo;ve
got.”</p>

<p>The
damp seeped into our clothes as the mist curled. Fingers of it licked at
his ears. He rubbed his jaw, and I followed the motions of his white,
smooth hands. “What is it supposed to accomplish? This machine of
yours?”</p>

<p>I
blinked, and pinched a slip of tissue from behind my lip between my
tongue and teeth. “I don&rsquo;t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, that&rsquo;s an easy
answer.”</p>

<p>“If
I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?”</p>

<p>He
shifted to face me better. He&rsquo;d been alternating between this and facing
the street to my left for the past half hour, always leaning against the
waist-high fence I was sitting on. “It doesn&rsquo;t explain why you keep
trying to build it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I&rsquo;m just curious.”</p>

<p>“Oh,
come now.” He was smirking, but he was serious. “That&rsquo;s not an
acceptable answer.”</p>

<p>I
sighed. “No, it isn&rsquo;t.”</p>

<p>He
let me be silent, trying to think it through.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is. Say I find a way to build
the whole thing – someone with the whole blueprint I have Or enough to
bullshit the rest of their way. Then I&rsquo;ll have finished, and I&rsquo;ll see
what it means, right? That&rsquo;s what I want.”</p>

<p>I
looked at him, and he had his own moment to chew that over. Then he
grinned. “I just hate the word. &lsquo;Curiosity&rsquo;. It sounds so flimsy.
Compare it with someone saying, &lsquo;I want to <em>know</em>.&lsquo;”He&rsquo;d lost the grin at the last, and put
it back with practiced timing. “They don&rsquo;t seem like the same
thing.”</p>

<p>I
was nodding along. “The second is more powerful. As though it could
shake your bones.”</p>

<p>“Split them and eat the marrow.” He
laughed, falling back on the fence to face the street again. I smiled,
and looked down.</p>

<p>When
I looked up again, he was watching me, and the pause had stretched too
long.</p>

<p>I
didn&rsquo;t try to break it.</p>

<p>Somehow, he found the moment, and spoke
again. “Maybe this is the solution to your problem.” He stopped, and
looked at me. I couldn&rsquo;t open my mouth – it had been glued shut from
being kept too long committed to staying that way. He smiled as if he
knew the issue. “How about I stick around until you want me to leave. We
don&rsquo;t have to say anything.”</p>

<p>When
I could, I said, “You don&rsquo;t have to do that.” My voice, nervous, was too
soft, and I had to repeat myself.</p>

<p>He
rubbed his jaw again. There were red spots on his hands, behind his
knuckles, between his tendons. It bought him a moment or two to consider
what he said.</p>

<p>“I&rsquo;m
reasonably certain I want to. I&rsquo;m not done with this yet.”</p>

<p>Damp
made his hair heavy, and it was beginning to drip onto his
forehead.</p>

<p>I
hopped off the fence, and stretched forward with my hands still on it.
Then I turned, and jerked my head to my right.</p>

<p>“Come on, let&rsquo;s go inside. We&rsquo;ll get a
cold.”</p>

<p>He
lifted a corner of his mouth. “Why not. You have hot chocolate?”</p>

    <li><h3>Blind</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/blind/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span><br /><p>We die; we are killed, we are weathered, are felled, are decayed,<br />
We remain living, watching the ghosts that our murders have made<br />
We suffer our punishments at unseen, untouchable hands;<br />
We write our poetry in languages no one else understands.</p>

<p>I look at you, and my mind is unbound, unfettered in storm<br />
Undoing ghost, what were the murders that made such a form?<br />
I write myself over once more for your unseeing eye,<br />
I look at you, self-written cryptic, and suffer, and die.</p>

    <li><h3>A Dystopian Story</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/a-dystopian-story/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span><br /><p>&ldquo;Put that cheapot down, Helen.&rdquo;<br />
At the sound of the high-pitched voice, with its imperious tone, Helen
jumped so badly that the cornflower-blue teapot nearly fell out of her
hands. With hands still shaking, she slotted the teapot back into its
hexagonal niche in the wall, and the pneumatic door slid closed in front
of it almost before she could withdraw her hands again.<br />
Helen&rsquo;s daughter stood crossly in the doorway, hands on hips.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of that filthy old thing yet. In
fact, I think I will tomorrow.&rdquo;<br />
With a gusty sigh (made somewhat less impressive by her tiny lung
capacity), Helen&rsquo;s daughter skipped across the room towards the large
plush purple beanbag in the center.<br />
&ldquo;Daughter, no, please, please don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;<br />
The small child spun on her heel to face Helen, and stomped her foot.
She pressed a button on the remote control dangling from her wrist, and
Helen had to grit her teeth to hold back the scream. Helen always had to
be careful about her screams when she was punished - some children liked
them, she knew from the Manual, but not her daughter.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t *argue*with me.&rdquo;<br />
Helen knew she wasn&rsquo;t really that angry - she had remembered to spin on
her heel and stomp her foot, after all. That meant she was doing it for
show. It was only respectable to reprimand a parent for speaking out of
turn, and PurpleLava was eminently respectable.<br />
It was also only respectable to have the teapot vaporized if she
expressed a wish to preserve it. It broke just about every rule of
respectability in this enlightened era to preserve an object established
as old, on the entreaties of a <em>parent</em>. Helen knew it was hopeless,
could feel it in her aching spine. Still, she had to give it a try.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, daughter. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, should I have?&rdquo;<br />
Helen&rsquo;s daughter calmed.<br />
&ldquo;No, you shouldn&rsquo;t have. But that&rsquo;s okay, if you know that.&rdquo; She
fidgeted with the pin-and-purple plastic beads on her wrist. &ldquo;Why should
I keep it, anyway?&rdquo;<br />
Helen smiled. She knew she was much better off than most parents were in
their homes, with a daughter like hers. PurpleLava (that was the name
she had most recently picked for herself, and the folks at the
Development Centre said that it was a sign of an out-of-the-box,
progressive bent of mind) was on her way to being a Scientist. That made
her more open-minded to ideas that Helen put forward, even if they were
by definition backward ideas, coming from a parent.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curiosity. It&rsquo;s not something that you see everyday, is it? Even
if it is filthy and old.&rdquo;<br />
PurpleLava rolled her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>boring</em> curiosity. It was invented
how long ago? It doesn&rsquo;t matter at <em>all</em>.&rdquo; She scoffed. &ldquo;What kind of a
name is cheapot for a curiosity, anyway?&rdquo;<br />
Helen tensed; she had to pick her words yet more carefully. &ldquo;Yes, but
nobody in the latest generation has looked at it yet. It&rsquo;s so old, it&rsquo;s
almost a natural object, isn&rsquo;t it? So maybe you could see something in
it that people couldn&rsquo;t before. And you can always rename it.&rdquo;<br />
PurpleLava considered this, her thumb in her mouth. Then she took it out
and nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not <em>such</em> a bad idea. Even if it is filthy and old,
I guess I could look at it a bit before we vaporize it.&rdquo;<br />
Helen nearly collapsed with relief. It would be months before the
question of the filthy old thing in the wall occurred to her daughter
again. Until then, the teapot was safe. With shaking fingers, she pushed
the button to close the receptacle. It slid shut with a pneumatic
hiss.<br />
PurpleLava was already skipping off, headed for her home lab. She had
already lost interest.<br />
Helen would have been a Scientist in her day - but there was a genetic
weakness in her mother&rsquo;s side, and she came down with a disease when
they were children. Helen had been quarantined for three years, and
hadn&rsquo;t been able to attend the Development Centre at the right ages. She
had stayed at home spending more time alone with her mother than was
considered healthy for a modern progressive child.<br />
Her mother had been a foreigner, and she had had a number of filthy old
things with her. One by one, Helen had had them vaporized - they weren&rsquo;t
respectable in the slightest, and her visiting colleagues would have
found them disgusting - but once she started staying at home, she did
this less and less; and the last one, the teapot, was left until after
her mother turned forty, and she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to get rid of
it.<br />
She hadn&rsquo;t always been called Helen. She had been GreenPony, and Starry,
and SunsetButterfly, but had eventually changed her name to what her
mother had always called her. No one knew what it meant, but Helen was
sure it was old. PurpleLava didn&rsquo;t like people to know that it came from
Helen&rsquo;s parent - a parent&rsquo;s parent, a thought vaguely nauseating in
itself. It was a serious embarrassment to her. Helen was often punished
for it when PurpleLava was in a bad mood, but parent names weren&rsquo;t that
important anyway, so none of her colleagues ever found out, and Helen
was allowed to keep it.<br />
Fingering the bruised skin around the electrode at the back of her neck,
Helen wondered what PurpleLava would say if she knew that Helen still
sometimes used the word mother in her head.<br />
She also wondered if Purple Lava knew what the teapot was made out of.
Probably not - she had never even touched the teapot before, and she
hadn&rsquo;t seen the stuff before either. Helen tasted on her tongue that
foreign idea, the idea that she knew something her daughter didn&rsquo;t. It
wasn&rsquo;t a new idea to her. After all, she knew because her mother had
told her.<br />
What it was was something called tchina. Her mother had owned a lot of
the stuff. If it broke, the pieces would be sharp.</p>

<p>Helen turned the idea over and under in her mind, considering.</p>
