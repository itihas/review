    <li><h3>Preludes</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/preludes/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>The problem with the world today is a lack of destruction.</p>

<p>I say this despite knowing that most will find the notion perfectly
counterintuitive – and that&rsquo;s the problem: we have come to a place, in
our collective psyche, where we find the necessity of destruction
counterintuitive. This is far from a natural or healthy state.</p>

<p>Humans aren&rsquo;t born with respect for only creative or preservative
processes; we&rsquo;re born without the barriers that tell us not to pull
things down, to tear them apart, to kill them or crush them or stomp on
them. They are inverse twins, creation and destruction, that build
cycles that hold eternal fascination and infinite beauty for our minds;
it is a beauty we learn before we are old enough or slow enough to be
properly taught anything. You see it in children: blocks are used to
create the most elaborate, storied constructions, as tall as their
makers, which are really only built so they can be torn down again –
fists are punched through their centres, cornerstones are pulled away,
and small palms are clapped in glee as the castle comes crashing to the
ground. (“Building blocks.”) The pattern is ubiquitous to all childhood:
Sand castles slaved over for hours get kicked up when the tides come in.
Girls&rsquo; pigtails get pulled. Low tables get turned over. Milk gets
spilled. Knees and hands are torn up in efforts to run as fast as legs
can carry you. Childhood, after all, is the passionate pursuit of
entropy, through any and all means. Nothing in childhood is ever
repeated. Nothing acquires that dull, comfortable sheen of sameness to
other things that characterises our every attitude towards the world as
adults. The best agents of entropy are creation and destruction, and we
find their dichotomy everywhere in the exercise of children&rsquo;s agency.</p>

<p>The structures we are taught to think in, on the other hand, rely on
sameness. We reduce all thinking to the manipulation of it, kill the
openness of our minds with grey walls of abstraction to fence all our
experiences; we build entire cities of invariant boxes that claim,
laughably, to represent what they contain. We give them the
contemptible, paradoxical moniker of &lsquo;systems of thought&rsquo;; and posit
with desperate conviction their sufficiency for all human activity; and
invent new ones to hide behind whenever the whisper of truth reveals to
us the converse. Language. Logic. Science. Politics.</p>

<p>Inexorably, inevitably, piece by required piece, we become so reliant on
these grey walls and the mountainous, intractable structures they&rsquo;ve
been assembled into, that we lose sense of what they are and what we
are. Like fools, we call their mess, their senseless profusion, the same
names we had for the glorious, ephemeral beauties of things we last
properly saw too long ago to remember; equality becomes our stand-in for
diversity, war becomes our stand-in for battle, monument becomes our
stand-in for art. We mistake complexity, and scale beyond comprehension,
for entropy; and proceed to spend our life adding to it in some effort
to replicate the effortless feeling of childhood, when everything was
madness, madness that words couldn&rsquo;t pin down and that no one else could
ever see.</p>

<p>But we are, against our best efforts, still human, and our inherences
don&rsquo;t change; and we still love what we learned to love before we were
taught anything, to tear things down. It is impossible in the world we
created, and unthinkable to tear the world down. So we compartmentalize
and rationalize the love away, trying to lose it in structure so that we
don&rsquo;t have to look at it straight. We call it the cost of change, we
call it a perverse urge, we call it rage, we call it stress, we call it
progress. We call it genius or psychosis in others so we can pretend not
to understand. We try to medicate it away. We try to find acceptable
targets for it, and acceptable ways to indulge it. We try to relegate it
to other places a thousand miles distant, miles measured over oceans and
mountains and lines on maps, so we can tut at it like pigeons and
pretend to be powerless about its effects.</p>

<p>There are those of us who enjoy watching this structure and these people
as they tick forward by degrees into their own destruction; against
odds, we remember and face our love of falls, of breaks, of violence. We
sit at the edge of the stage, eating popcorn as if we were audience, and
every so often we get up to go among the main players and walk around,
and stroke people&rsquo;s backs to make them shiver, or claw at their cheeks
from behind, and say, “Boo!” so that they jump out of place or forget
their lines. We cackle madly as some corner of the play derails, and the
chances for the production&rsquo;s success grow yet worse.</p>

<p>This is one such stage corner. Some would call it a horror story.</p>

    <li><h3>Rorschach on Parquet</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/rorschach-on-parquet/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>The
dress was two-layered, and baggy around the torso, falling straight from
the shoulders and held in place at the waist by an elastic band. On a
thinner woman, it might have looked airy or draping.</p>

<p>A
much, much thinner woman. An anorexic woman.</p>

<p>From
the elastic, it fell nearly to the ground – would have, if not for the
heels that acccompanied it, strappy plastic-gloss patents in a shade
that brought out the florid pinks of the print flowers vividly against
the black backing. That inner layer lasted only until an inch above the
knees, leaving the chiffon layer – slit high at the sides – perfectly
transparent to the skin. The wispy ends wrapped around her ankles in the
breeze, getting caught on the silver clasps of the shoestraps. They were
far too insubstantial to actually hinder movement, but it seemed like
they would cause her to trip at any moment. Her unsteadiness on her feet
didn&rsquo;t help matters.</p>

<p>The
whiskey sloshed around in her heavy-bottomed lowball glass as she sipped
from it, raised it high in the air in salute, moved it in circles as she
gesticulated. There wasn&rsquo;t much left in the glass, but small splashes
found their way out nonetheless, coating her hand and making faded
designs on the pale parquet. The rim of the glass was covered in
lipstick smudges, almost all the way around; near the crook of her
finger was a neat, tiny kiss print, in rich pink that made it visible
from a distance. Her voice, uneven in pitch and volume but rarely
pausing except to breathe and drink – echoed faintly along the
corridor.</p>

<p>The
spills were wiped away almost the second they landed, and the talking
could be muffled if it came to that – but her shoes were scuffing the
floor wax.</p>

<p>This
was the chief worry.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much time left to do anything
about it. The waxing happened once every three months, and was
laborious, requiring several days of work, coordinated meticulously to
ensure minimal obstruction of the household&rsquo;s everyday functioning;
sections of the floor partitioned and choreographed like a garba or a
Broadway musical. The wax was an import, and the workers who applied it
were from Delhi. Nobody knew anything about the process beyond
this.</p>

<p>There were fifteen, perhaps twenty minutes
left.</p>

<p>Warm
water was suggested, and the unfortunate speaker roundly abused. Water
was anathema, this much was known. Various cleaning solutions were
considered, but none could say which was safe and which
not.</p>

<p>Five
minutes passed. Panic was setting in. Several of the less experienced
looked about to faint. Hushed voices became hisses.</p>

<p>And
in the midst of it, a small canister was produced by a familiar
hand.</p>

<p>A
moment of utter silence passed before it was snatched away; a rag was
produced, hisses became excited whispers as it was wet and applied and
the marks disappeared like magic. Bottled absolution.</p>

<p>This
done, a few looked up at the saviour, who had moved on ahead of the
train, to catch up with its leader. The procession was stopped by a hand
on the wrist, and the crowd caught up as well, spilling around the
spectacle.</p>

<p>Quiet, firm words were spoken. A pout was
elicited.</p>

<p>The
whiskey would not be given up, but a bargain was struck to take the
shoes and put them away. House slippers were produced, and the bargainer
bent to effect the change.</p>

<p>She
watched, and giggled, swaying forward as if the sound came up out of her
stomach. Then she swayed some more as her foot was lifted, swatting away
an offered hand. When she put it back down shoeless, she cocked her hip,
jutting her leg out of the dress&rsquo;s side slit. She giggled some more, and
there was a collective gasp as she upended her glass over her
shoe-remover&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>After a moment, with movements perhaps a
little more abrupt, the other shoe was removed. The new problem now
stood and stepped back, and there was a rush to wipe away the giant
yellow Rorschach blot that had been left behind. A towel was offered and
used; hair was rearranged. Once-neat cotton, mercifully dark, was dabbed
at.</p>

<p>Abruptly, everyone dispersed. The problem was
resolved and time was up. The chiffon caught on the door its wearer had
been whisked through, and was tugged free. The towel was snatched away
mid-use.</p>

<p>And
he came walking down the corridor, house slippers
soundless.</p>

<p>The
scapegoat had already been seen, but no breath could be heard, even in
the silence of the arcade.</p>

<p>He
moved at a measured pace.</p>

<p>He
never turned his head. When he reached the stiff figure standing frozen
at the fringe of the path, he paused; sniffed twice, examined it
briefly, and shifted his gaze straight ahead once more.</p>

<p>Two
doors past her was his office. The sound of his door closing echoed
faintly in the silence of the corridor.</p>

<p>The
unfortunate took a shaky breath, and walked in the opposite direction;
and two left turns later, entered a room and closed the
door.</p>

<p>It
wasn&rsquo;t as quiet a corridor as the other, but it wasn&rsquo;t a busy one
either. Anyone who heard the muffled screams from inside passed on their
way after a moment. It stopped off soon enough.</p>

    <li><h3>Inevitable</h3><a href="https://itihas.review/writing/inevitable/">.</a><br /><span class="date">Sun, Aug 10, 2014</span><br /><p>My voice cracked, but it was so far past the
point where that would have mattered. “You bastard. You bastard. You
left anyway. You&rsquo;re going to do this anyway.”</p>

<p>His hand shook, hesitated, but I&rsquo;d never
witnessed an action that felt as inevitable as when he lifted it to my
cheek. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at the gentleness on his
face.</p>

<p>“It isn&rsquo;t me if I don&rsquo;t.”</p>

<p>I covered his hand with mine. It took me a
moment to realize why it was damp.</p>

<p>And I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t try to stop
him.</p>
