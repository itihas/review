Something poetic in learning that maybe it's okay to die, that there really is nothing essentially necessary about hurting. that all of this is optional.
</p>

<p>
I want to live. It is a small flame in cool water, undeniably there, and the superstructure is trying to mirror it above on the surface, desperate and striving, but if it wasn't so scared of the water it could just reach down through it and find the real desire and let it fuel me. Some things got room to breathe. I feel like I noticed a third path, but I feel like it's important to me that the third path is an <i>option</i>. It's a <i>choice</i> and I can choose differently.

i try to say the true thing and the true thing is always this - that I am everywhere. that "I" is a fiction and indispensable. That I cobble myself together in the corner of the street when I decide where to go. that I find myself in the shadow of my forward foot. i don't know what's happening but i don''t have to. im out ahead of myself. i'm underneath myself. i support myself. i am not a resource to be extracted, I'm an elephant to ride, a swell of wave to survive.

This sort of thing used to feel easier. There was a natural way I once was, where I'd ruminate about something for a while, and then when someone asked me what was on my mind I'd describe the precise structure of the story I was telling myself, what emotional need it served, and what emotion undergirded it. But that process <i>hurt</i>. I'd tell the whole thing as if it was about someone I didn't like or respect, someone I was close to - tethered to, even - but whose choices and drives frustrated and disgusted me. Underneath that contempt was fear. I felt like I was in an unsafe world, that my way-of-being, my desires and inclinations, were not safe.
</p>

<p>
The hate floats like scum on the surface of the fear. That sense of <i>unsafe</i> is deeper and clearer. The hate is loud, but just&#x2026;different. It dissolves because it doesn't make sense in context.
</p>

<p>
Compared to my old way of doing things, this all goes so, so slow.

&#x2026;to wring myself out and fill myself up and wring myself out again and again and again and hope that the stains wash out as well as they can and if not at least the smell and caking will go and i can bend and flex and breathe again. i want to clean. i want to be clean. i want to be wrung out well enough to be like new again - never mistaken for new but just as good; the ivory tea stained dish towel you reach for because it's soft and clean and reliable and curls to your touch appealingly. i want ot rest on a counter like i'm old and well-loved.

Unexpectedly, the fine needles in a really precisely crafted piece of work will touch me somewhere cramped. When they slide into willing flesh, these only create warmth, the electric shock of recognition, beautiful feelings to go with the true things, whose pain is to be embraced. But I am older now than I was, and when something touches me in my shoulders, in my neck, in my arms where my biceps are learning how to push and the points of tension built over years of carrying a strife that I thought in my foolish youth that I would defeat much sooner, when this happens I scream, because there the needles don't hurt good. They are grazing bubbles that have festered and jostling bones that are healing wrong and flinching shut muscles that are already like ingrown carnation petals with how cramped they have been for years together. To let the art in, I have to set aside time against the chance that this may happen. It is a wonder I read or listen or watch or let any of it in at all. It must be somethng humans crave, or else something that they need, because nothing else would explain it.

Fie on these prepositions, these subversive subservients to presuppositions! Servile only superficially, these are - opportunist suborners of the ground they bridge, they are, these empirical empiriacal demons of connective tissue, this maddening Greek chorus of structural commentary! I can never can say what I mean but that these prepository poltergeists twist it entirely - make a hegemon out of a nationalist, or a missionary out of an idealist, or a vile strategist or a churl out of a retreater! Serpent-tongued strictures of grammatical implicature - enumerators of the unenumerable, making casewise implicatures of things indivisible into categories! They admit of too much unless they admit of not enough - they are too useful to anybody but their user,

Kiss you and kiss me both because it is so hard to contain this joy and that's half the reason you don't come back, isn't it? Because you're <i>scared</i> of this joy. It's okay. We learned how to handle it yesterday. Feel thankful for it. Feel glad that you are feeling it <i>/right now</i>. Be glad for the connection you feel to your summers in the top bunk spent typing and the nights you spent in the computer room weaving and crafting worlds between pageloads.

To leave the place we are in we must stay there. To learn the trick of being swept up we must first prepare, To love the other we have to first hate them, because there is no other way to care.

&#x2026;I'm not trying to waste time explaining to you what you already feel, so much as I am trying to excavate what's already in my brain, while standing inside the bubble of the written word. I'm trying to dig through the walls of my mind, to gently uncover without breaking, the "implicit" knowledge.

It appears I will have to teach myself to write by writing my way into knowing. This organizational principle of synthesis by transcription is the most irritating thing. I don't <i>want</i> to obtain by serialization-deserialization. I <i>want</i> nothing more than this, but not to have to feel it. I stand in the shallow seawater, trying to learn how to cut across its waves and through the heaving body of it. I hate every moment and chase what I love about it as it flees before me. I cannot but pass through this fire that makes my skin buzz to get what I <i>want</i> from the world. I do not know this for sure but I know it pretty well.

(You know why synaesthesia sounds like bullshit? It's because we all do it, and nobody told us it was <i>allowed</i>. Those of us in whom it's too strong to ignore or whom nobody attended to inform of the injunction induce sour grapes. We are dismissive because we are outraged and we are outraged because we never realized the stakes were so low and we feel the obscenity of having mutilated ourselves for such low stakes. The damage is reversible, and you can recover to new strengths. Hold hard onto the hope that has just flared and keep your disappointments from poisoning your fellow man from now on.)

The shape of the leaves stirs me. The happenstance of the shape of a leaf is the most beautiful thing, and gives me the way to understand how a tree must think, being as it is in this same world I am. A tree, too, is muddying along, trying its best to figure out the rules of the world we live in, reaching into the crevices of it to anchor itself into the easy and simple, or easier and simpler, ways of being. A tree, too, discovers within itself capacities that were built in this same world, symmetries with no further explanation than the invariances it already has gleaned and the history of them in its blood and bones. A tree, too, is, and I don't think thinking is different from being for a human, or for a me at any rate, so this must be how a tree thinks.

I wish to write beside the brushstrokes, along every petal of the fanned daisies and within every crevice of the crinkled chrysanthemums and underlined by the ridges of paint in the folds of the skirt where it has ridden up and pools below her torso; and of course scrawled over and under and into the bare dark between her thighs, paint lewdly streaked and smeared to show where the light fails to touch. Where I cannot put my hands, my mouth, I will put the tip of my pen.

The forms of letters and words, you see, play in a heretical universe to the world of image. They are a repudiation of the extant relationships between sight and meaning, flagrant, without elegance, a diminishing of power in the main mode in a devil's trade for the emergent modes; blasphemous deletion of the baseline; poetry where impressionists retain the restraint to lyricise. This above all else is what I want to do to her.
