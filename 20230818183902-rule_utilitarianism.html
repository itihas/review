</p><p>For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, &quot;always stop at red lights&quot;). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances.

In rule utilitarianism, an operation with the same type signature as &quot;descriptiveness&quot; is used to attach sentences to actions, but in this case to filter them through the predetermined lens of a ruleset.
