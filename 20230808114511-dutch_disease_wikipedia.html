</p><p>The term was coined in 1977 by The Economist to describe the decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands after the discovery of the large Groningen natural gas field in 1959.[1]
</p><p>The presumed mechanism is that as revenues increase in the growing sector (or inflows of foreign aid), the given nation&#x27;s currency becomes stronger (appreciates) compared to currencies of other nations (manifest in an exchange rate). This results in the nation&#x27;s other exports becoming more expensive for other countries to buy, and imports becoming cheaper, making those sectors less competitive.
</p><p>While it most often refers to natural resource discovery, it can also refer to &quot;any development that results in a large inflow of foreign currency, including a sharp surge in natural resource prices, foreign assistance, and foreign direct investment&quot;.[2]
</p></blockquote><p> Thermodynamically open system? Seems formalisable. reminds me, <em>again</em>, of <a href="id:af3e5fec-e369-4092-af5e-c988ea94fe1b">Jeremy England?</a> but this is probably superficial and just to do with just the thermodynamics.
