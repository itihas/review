</p><blockquote><p>Abstract. We suggest that a process-like notion of strategy is relevant
in the context of interactions in systems of self-interested agents. In this
view, strategies are not plans formulated by rational agents consider-
ing all possible futures and (mutually recursively) taking into account
strategies employed by other players. Instead, they are partial; players
start with a set of potential strategies and dynamically switch between
them. This necessitates some means in the model for players to access
each others’ strategies, and we suggest a syntax by which players’ ra-
tionale for such switching may be specified and structurally composed.
In such a model one can ask a stability question: given a game arena
and a strategy specification, whether players eventually settle down to
strategies without further switching. We show that this problem can be
algorithmically solved using automata theoretic methods.
