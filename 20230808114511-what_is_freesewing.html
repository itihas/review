</p><p>We provide a core library for parametric pattern design, an ever-growing library of designs implemented in code, as well as a bunch of adjacent tools for building modern interfaces on top of our platform.
</p><p>We are not interested in fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into parametric designs + documentation, and make that information freely available.
</p><p>FreeSewing is built by contributors who are all volunteers, and financially supported by our Patrons.
