But the maps exist, right alongside the music. And good maps can save you centuries, soldiers, ships, fortunes. The danger: sitting at home hunched over your map table with a fixed grin thinking you’ve been places you haven’t. The balanced way is to study these maps while you cover the territory. By the time you know your way around the territory, the maps will have become torn and faded, and you won’t have to look at them anymore because the territory is teaching you more than the maps ever could.
