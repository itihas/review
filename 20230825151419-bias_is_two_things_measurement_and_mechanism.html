</p><blockquote><p>On the one hand, bias is an average error. On the other hand, it’s a psychological mechanism, and it’s a psychological observation. There are mechanisms that cause systematic errors in people’s judgments and in people’s decisions, and those errors are called biases. And it’s basically a psychological mechanism that explains events inside the individual—why an individual is inclined to make one mistake or another.
</p></blockquote><p>There is the value that is derived from observed error, and there is the latent set of factors that we assume drives the value. The connection between these is a posited causal model.
</p><p>Again, the error is characterised relative to a &quot;right answer&quot;, to a decision that reflects the latent set of concerns attributed to the actor generating the data.
</p><p>So in the case of bias, we have an actor&#x27;s &quot;win condition&quot;, then their observed actions, and the delta between these which call error. The mean of error is bias. This value is assumed to be driven by a feature of the mechanism that the actor in question runs to make decisions, which we therefore also call bias.
