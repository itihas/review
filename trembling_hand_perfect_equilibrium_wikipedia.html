A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy where every strategy (both pure and mixed) is played with non-zero probability. This is the &quot;trembling hands&quot; of the players; they sometimes play a different strategy, other than the one they intended to play. Then define a strategy set S (in a base game) as being trembling hand perfect if there is a sequence of perturbed games that converge to the base game in which there is a series of Nash equilibria that converge to S.
