What parts of my world count as seen
Is sometimes moved
And sometimes bruised
And one day it may die.
</p><p>All the words I ever knew
Won&#x27;t give it away to you
It sometimes screams
And sometimes dreams
And does it all alone.
</p><p>It holds within an ageless ache
Because, you see, it cannot break.
It sometimes sleeps
And else, it weeps.
I feel it in my bones.
</p><p>Kiss me, I may say, and hope
You&#x27;ll draw it out upon a rope
You lower through
What&#x27;s told as true
And taste it where it lies.
