</p><p>The seed of the idea was born with <a title="Playing Games with Games: The Hypergame Paradox" href="/zwickerplaying1987">Zwicker</a>&#x27;s notion of a hypergame - i.e. a game with only one move: &quot;select a finite game to play&quot; - that is intended as a construction of a paradox (is hypergame a fginite game?) It suggests, however, restrictions of the same concept, that are good for more things - like for example strategic selection among <em>games</em> or even <em>rules</em> (game properties or features).
</p><p>Similarly paradox-driven explorations of the concept followed  - see <a href="/20250202203652-nomic">Nomic</a>.
</p><p>The concept was further developed by Nigel Howard to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagame_analysis#CITEREFHoward1971">metagame analysis</a> - a &quot;nonquantitative&quot; reconstruction of game theory <a title="Paradoxes of Rationality: Games, Metagames, and Political Behaviour. Cambridge: MIT Press" href="/howardParadoxesRationalityGames1971">Howard</a>  that enabled the analysis of tradeoffs between propositional statements about the world, or of &quot;enforcing a property to be true&quot;.
</p><p>I&#x27;m attempting a formal construction of the same / a similar idea by drawing on game semantics.
