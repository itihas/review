</p></li></ul><h1 id="logic">Logic</h1><p>The project here was to formally represent player-editable games - games whose structure depended on players (i.e. on player <em>strategic action</em>, either via their preferences or their available moves).
We can conceive of this as <em>strategic selection among alternative games</em> - , i.e. playing a <em>metagame</em>. There are several ways to approach this idea. I&#x27;ve detailed my attempted approaches chronologically.

This is effectively a formalization of a <em>Nomic</em>-like game <a title="Appendix 3: Nomic: A Game of Self-Amendment" href="/suberappendix1990">Suber</a>. We quickly run into Suber&#x27;s original issue with Nomic: either a game simplifies to something that can&#x27;t be called <em>editing</em>, or it&#x27;s too underspecified to be able to make positive claims about.

</p><h1 id="confluence-preference-meronomy">Confluence: Preference meronomy</h1><p>Two central questions can now be asked, in several different spheres of concern:
</p><ul><li><p>Given a collection of <em>agents</em> - purposive, complex, mutually aware actors - what can we say about the world they construct in the pursuit of their goals? Can we infer form from function?
</p></li><li><p>Given a world, inhabited and constructed by agents - can we say <em>the world as a whole</em> wants something? Can we infer function from form?
</p></li></ul><h1 id="post-mortem">Post mortem</h1><p>What went wrong here? What could have gone better?
</p><ul><li><p>Spread too thin. I had <em>too many ideas</em> and did not follow through on any of them enough in the time I had. - Sparse specialised guidance. I did not have enough guidance <em>a priori</em>, and did not reach out to suitable guides.
</p></li><li><p>Insufficient feedback. I didn&#x27;t finish or share <em>anything</em> until well far too late.
</p></li><li><p>Inadequate <em>general</em> guidance. How to write a paper? How often should one request/receive feedback? What is the appropriate way to reach out to other academics? I didn&#x27;t know.
</p></li></ul><h1 id="thank-you">Thank you.</h1><p>Despite obstacles, I enjoyed my time here and the work of answering questions I cared about.
