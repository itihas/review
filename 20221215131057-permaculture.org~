#+title: permaculture


The practice of gardening or farming with a view to creating a self-sustaining ecosystem, and possibly one that produces a reliable agricultural output.


Something something emergent properties.

The tendency of nature to pile accidents on accidents is really beautiful, I remember thinking about it on the hike we took on 2022-11-05. It was really lovely.

Permaculture also makes me think of cooking, and how the smooth running of cooking is something that follows from low-level details (because [[id:55b05db4-8350-4387-80b4-16c7774c6cf2][Reality is Surprisingly Detailed]]) that almost get chunked too fast to process that you're learning them. When we cooked for the first time in Sid's kitchen a little thing like water boiling at a different pace was enough to throw me off. Surprisingly fragile. (Thinking of cooking in this context makes me think of [cite:@ashokMasalaLabScience2021], which has a lovely discussion of the traditional learning process of an Indian kitchen and how its explanations are often post-hoc with characteristci post-hoc inaccuracies.)


In the outskirts of Hyderabad there is a teaching farm for permaculture called [[https://permacultureindia.org/about-permaculture/][Aranya Agricultural Alternatives]] with a dude named Narsanna in it.

Books recommended by Narsanna:
- [[id:0dcb7b9a-ad69-4eb4-a42a-93d652cc3e3b][Masanobu Fukuoka - The One-Straw Revolution]]
- [[id:7c0fe20d-956c-46ab-8c1c-afc7e36c1435][Bill Mollison and David Holgren - Permaculture One]]


It should be noted that tropical permaculture differs importantly in particulars from temperate permaculture - which is to say, which biome you're in influences your strategies significantly. Discovering the parameters that determine these differences would let us /derive/ first principles of ecology, and the mode of inquiry must necessarily be naturalistic and bottom-up. Like playing an interactive game.
